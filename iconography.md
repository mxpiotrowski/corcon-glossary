"The terms ‘iconography’ and ‘iconology’ were launched in the art-historical world in the 1920s and 1930s. To be more exact, they were relaunched – a famous Renaissance handbook of images, published by Cesare Ripa in 1593, already bore the title *Iconologia*, while the term ‘iconography’ was in use in the early nineteenth century. By the 1930s the use of these terms had become associated with a reaction against a predominantly formal analysis of paintings in terms of composition or colour at the expense of the subject matter. The practice of icono- graphy also implies a critique of the assumption of photographic real-ism in our ‘snapshot culture’. The ‘iconographers’, as it is convenient to call these art historians, emphasize the intellectual content of works of art, their implicit philosophy or theology." [@Burke2001, 34-35]
