"One of the principal concerns of iconography is the discovery of symbolic and allegorical meanings in a work of art [...] Historically, the terms ‘iconography’ and ‘iconology’ have often been used loosely and interchangeably. However, a distinction between the two can be made: in the modern sense iconography involves the collection, classification and analysis of data, from which the theme or subject of a work of art is deduced. Iconology, on the other hand, starting from the results of iconography, attempts to explain the very basis for the existence of a work of art and its entire meaning. [...] for art history today iconology and iconography continue to be most fruitful as methods for understanding the meaning of art."

"The terms ‘iconography’ and ‘iconology’ were launched in the art-historical world in the 1920s and 1930s. To be more exact, they were relaunched – a famous Renaissance handbook of images, published by Cesare Ripa in 1593, already bore the title *Iconologia*, while the term ‘iconography’ was in use in the early nineteenth century. By the 1930s the use of these terms had become associated with a reaction against a predominantly formal analysis of paintings in terms of composition or colour at the expense of the subject matter. The practice of iconography also implies a critique of the assumption of photographic realism in our ‘snapshot culture’. The ‘iconographers’, as it is convenient to call these art historians, emphasize the intellectual content of works of art, their implicit philosophy or theology." [@Burke2001, 34-35]
