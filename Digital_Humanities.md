The “double definition” proposed in [@Piotrowski2018a] is:

1. [[20220415253800]] **theoretical digital humanities**: research on and development of means and methods for constructing [[20220415235200]] formal models (specifically: [[20220415227300]] computational models) in the [[20220415238200]] humanities, and
2. [[20220415224200]] **applied digital humanities**: the application of these means and methods for the construction of *concrete* formal models in the humanities disciplines.

We consider theoretical digital humanities a [[isa:20220415232500]] discipline in its own right [see also @Piotrowski2020b].  In contrast, applied digital humanities is a generic term covering computational approaches *in* the various humanities disciplines; sometimes they have specific designations, such as [[20220415230800]] digital history or computational literary studies.

[TODO] Say something about the relation to [[20220616094610]] computational humanities [@Meunier2014; @Piotrowski2020b].
