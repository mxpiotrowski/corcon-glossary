Our [@Piotrowski2018a] definition is:

1. research on and development of means and methods for constructing formal models in the [[20220415238200]] humanities (*theoretical digital humanities*), and
2. the application of these means and methods for the construction of *concrete* formal models in the humanities disciplines (*applied digital humanities*).

Applied digital humanities, e.g., [[20220415230800]] digital history, are subfields of their mother disciplines.  However, we consider theoretical digital humanities a [[isa:20220415232500]] discipline in its own right [see also @Piotrowski2020b].
