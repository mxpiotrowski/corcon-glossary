Georg Klaus (* December 28, 1912 in Nuremberg, † July 29, 1974 in Berlin) was a German Marxist [[20220418190114]] philosopher, cybernetician, chess master, and functionary.  Klaus was one of the main promotors of the study of cybernetics in the GDR.  [[20231226211230]] Max Bense was Klaus’ PhD supervisor in Jena.

For us, primarily his writings on cybernetics [@Klaus1961; @Klaus1966b] are of interest.
