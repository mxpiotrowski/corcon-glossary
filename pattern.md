Many people associate formalization and computation with mathematization, and as @Granger1967 [110] has observed, it is still true that “for many who work in the humanities, mathematization is equivalent to the introduction of quantity, indeed of number.”  This is, however, a fallacy, and also Granger stressed that formalization in the humanities consists in the transition from the unstructured to the structural, rather than in [[20220415248700]] quantification [@Granger1967, 113].

> Il semble donc qu’une élaboration scientifique des notions qualitatives consiste dans le passage de l’astructuré au structural, bien plutôt que dans une quantification.

As @Granger1967 [19] points out, there is a common confusion between formal thought and the work of mathematicians.  While it is quite true in a sense that all effective scientific formalism tends towards a mathematical form, this still does not mean that the formalism is unavoidably reduced to the *usual* and *current* instruments of mathematics.  And he asks: is it not just this supposed reduction that the opponents of all formalization in the humanities are criticizing?  It will be one of the aspects of our task, Granger says, to show formal thought at work in the humanities, not only as a reduction of phenomena to calculations, but also as the invention of new structures, even, indeed, of an original mathematics.

> À cet égard, il convient de dissiper un préjugé qui nuit souvent à l’appréciation qu’on peut faire de la valeur du formalisme dans les sciences. C’est la confusion que l’on favorise d’ordinaire entre la pensée formelle et l’œuvre des mathématiciens. S’il est bien vrai en un sens que tout formalisme scientifique efficace tend vers un statut mathématique, ce n’est pas pour autant qu’il se réduise infailliblement aux instruments *usuels* et *actuels* des géomètres. N’est-ce pas cependant à cette réduction supposée que s’attaquent essentiellement les adversaires de toute formalisation dans les sciences de l’homme ? Ce sera l’un des aspects de notre tâche que de montrer la pensée formelle à l’œuvre dans les sciences humaines, non pas seulement comme réduction des phénomènes aux calculs, mais aussi comme invention de structures nouvelles, voire même d’une mathématique originale.

I believe that this could really be considered the main challenge of [[20220415230900]] digital humanities.

It also highlights a limitation of current DH research, which is overwhelmingly quantitative, whereas humanities research questions are ultimately qualitative, *why?* questions.  The “original mathematics” that Granger envisioned have thus to be understood as “mathematics without numbers” [@Kemeny1959], a general “science of patterns” [@Resnik1999].

> Much philosophical thinking about [[20220415242500]] mathematics is guided by a fundamental misconception of the subject-matter of mathematics.  We tend to conceive of the numbers, say, along the same lines as we think of tables or stars or even atoms.  That is, we think of them as objects that can be discussed and known in isolation from the others.  This is why we are likely to think that discovering something about a number should depend upon some sort of interaction between us and that number, and to believe that this ought to be reflected in a satisfactory epistemology for mathematics.  It is also why we are likely to hold that the identity of a number *vis-à-vis* any other object should be completely determined.  However, for some time the practice of pure mathematics has reflected the idea that mathematics Is concerned with structures involving mathematical objects and not with the ‘internal’ nature of the objects themselves.  Mathematicians as prominent as Dedekind, Hilbert, and Poincaré have even voiced structuralist ideas in reflecting philosophically on mathematics.  More recently the structuralist approach has been credited with fostering category theory.

> The underlying philosophical idea here is that in mathematics the primary subject-matter is not the individual mathematical objects but rather the structures in which they are arranged. The objects of mathematics, that is, the entities which our mathematical constants and quantifiers denote, are themselves atoms, structureless points, or positions in structures.  And as such they have no identity or distinguishing features outside a structure.

> For epistemological purposes I find it more suggestive to speak of mathematical patterns and their positions rather than of structures.  For this brings out important similarities between mathematical knowledge and other knowledge such as grammatical and musical knowledge.  But the term [[20220616094639]] ‘structuralism’ has a better ring to it than ‘patternism’, so the philosophical literature invariably speaks of structures instead of patterns. In what follows I will use the terms ‘pattern’ and ‘structure’ more or less interchangeably.

@Resnik1999 [202] also notes: “I know of no developed philosophical account of patterns,” but I do not know whether this still true today.  [TODO]
