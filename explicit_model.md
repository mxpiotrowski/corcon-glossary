Epstein clarifies the difference between an explicit and an implicit model. He states: 
> it is an implicit model in which the assumptions are hidden, their internal consistency is untested, their logical consequences are unknown, and their relation to data is unknown. … In explicit models, assumptions are laid out in detail, so we can study exactly what they entail. … By writing explicit models, you let others replicate your results. -@Epstein2008

He adds, that explicit models demostrate more advantages than implicit ones, especially when it comes to scholarly discourse, where the feasibility and transparency of the scientific notions are of importance:
> Another advantage of explicit models is the feasibility of sensitivity analysis. One can sweep a huge range of parameters over a vast range of possible scenarios to identify the most salient uncertainties, regions of robustness, and important thresholds. I don't see how to do that with an implicit mental model. -@Epstein2008
