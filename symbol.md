"Term used to describe certain types of sign that are designed to extend the realm of [[20220616094637]] representation, particularly so as to incorporate abstract [[20220616094622]] ideas. Though overlapping in function, they are broadly less sophisticated in operation and meaning than [[20220616094601]] allegories [...], of which they might form elements. [...]
an element in an [[20220415238900]] image may be termed a symbol precisely when the relation with its object is not purely, or at all, [[20220616094624]] mimetic. In the same way as with the stylistic devices and tropes of everyday language, e.g. the laurels of victory, such an image would be puzzling if read ‘literally’ as merely a [[20220616094637]] depiction of actual objects and so prompts a symbolic [[20220415240200]] interpretation. [...]
Symbols are best known as a means of facilitating the representation of subjects that do not lend themselves to mimesis, as with the direct and indirect symbols used to denote abstract [[20220415227900]] concepts and the transcendental, or to identify otherwise [[20220616094602]] ambiguous characters and so on. [...]
[Symbols] which are especially open to interpretation by dubious inferences and whose meaning may never be established with any certainty. Notable examples of such symbols are those connected with religion and poetry. There is thus a danger that the exegesis of a symbolic object can engender additional symbolism of a kind that was perhaps not intended by its inventor or that cannot be justified by the historical context.

Note: or **sign**? In Aristotle's Rhetoric "signs are 'things [that] are so closely related that the presence or absence of one indicates the presence or absence of the other.'"

Semiotics:
"Term referring to the analysis of signs and their use. In one sense, it can be applied specifically to the set of principles developed for the analysis of signs by the American philosopher, Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914). However, semiotics has also come to acquire a more general meaning, incorporating not only the ideas of Peirce but also semiology, a term usually applied strictly to the theories of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) and his disciples, which reached its peak in the 1960s (see also Structuralism and Barthes, Roland). In this more general sense, semiotics and semiology, the latter a term that can also be applied loosely, are sometimes used almost interchangeably, but can be differentiated. This is principally due to the more eclectic practice and wider social implications of semiotics, which has relinquished the scientific claims of semiological analysis. It nevertheless offers a distinctive and cogent technique for dissecting the complexities of visual and verbal communication."
