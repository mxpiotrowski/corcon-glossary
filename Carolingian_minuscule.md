Carolingian minuscule is a model script which was developed as a calligraphic standard in the medieval European period, so that the Latin alphabet of Jerome's Vulgate Bible could be easily recognized by the literate class from one region to another. It is thought to have originated before 778 AD at the scriptorium of the Benedictine monks of Corbie Abbey, about 150 km north of Paris and then developed by Alcuin of York for wide use in the Carolingian Renaissance. Alcuin was still writing in a script which was a precursor the Carolingian minuscule and which slowly developed over three centuries. He was most likely responsible for copying and preserving the manuscripts and the payment of its upkeep. It was widely used in the Holy Roman Empire between approximately 800 and 1200 AD, when codices, pagan and Christian texts, and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule.
