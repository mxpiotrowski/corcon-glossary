[Pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics) is the study of language in use and the contexts in which it is used, including such matters as deixis, the taking of turns in conversation, text organization, presupposition, and implicature.

Whereas [[20220616094638]] semantics is concerned with meaning in the abstract, pragmatics is interested in the concrete meaning of an utterance in a concrete context.
