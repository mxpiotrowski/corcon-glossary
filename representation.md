"A relation holding between a picture (or three-dimensional object) and some other thing, in virtue of which the picture (or [[20220415238900]] image) is said to be, in some special sense, ‘of’ that thing. The picture (or image) need not be a work of art, and the thing that it is ‘of’ may be either an object (where this includes a person or other animal as well as an inanimate thing) [i.e. an [[20220616094614]] entity] or an event."
