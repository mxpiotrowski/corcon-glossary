>Les modèles formels de type computationnel sont un sous-ensemble des modèles formels mathématiques. Comme ces derniers, ils utilisent des systèmes symboliques qui se caractérisent par un type particulier de manipulations de symboles et de formules. En effet, ces systèmes permettent d’effectuer un calcul sur les formules et de décider si elles appartiennent ou n’appartiennent pas au système dans lequel elles sont définies. Si telle est le cas, ces formules sont alors dites calculables et décidables.

> But Bloxham needs robust conceptual tools to do this, since speaking strictly from within historiography would lead him into the same scattershot thinking that the historians whom he critiques use. He has two strong pairs of concepts, which will be my focus in much of what follows. The first major group of concepts he brings to bear for this purpose is causation and context and the relations between them. As he says, “few historians have tried to conceptualize” context, though most talk about it (3). His view is that context “means nothing other than ‘cause’ and, generally in humanistic explanations, cause in the weaker sense of ‘influence’ as opposed to the stronger sense of ‘determination’” (17–18). As he explains, “context tends to be seen as more fundamental than ‘cause,’ but there is, in fact, no conceptual distinction between a cause and a context. … [B]oth have influence over an eventualization, and what has influence over an eventu- alization is a cause” (30). Bloxham’s neologism “eventualization” enables him to skip around some difficult issues in philosophy of science and metaphysics here.
