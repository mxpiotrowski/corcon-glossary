[[20220415228300]] corpus

Even though it is not fully clear on whether it is a methodology [[20220418210120]] or a scientific discipline [[20220415232500]] in its own right, most will agree that corpus linguistics [[20220616094612]] is based on the analysis [[20220616094603]] of corpora [[20220415228300]] which are collections of naturally occurring examples of language a.k.a. texts [[20220415253200]] (@Gries2009). The notion of corpus [[20220415228300]] plays a key role, as it serves as the scientific object for every study conducted within the field. However, most of the focus is placed on the computational methods that analyze the corpus [[20220415228300]] and not the corpus [[20220415228300]] itself, as a model [[20220415244100]] of the phenomenon [[20220415246700]] it illustrates. 

In our understanding, corpus linguistics [[20220616094612]] consist of the application of formal modeling in a set of predefined items, guided by a set of rules or criteria for the selection, as well as the analysis [[20220616094603 ]] of these items. The concept of formal modeling helps us to understand the quantitative nature of the research conducted on corpora [[20220415228300]], a research that is not concerned with questions of ‘why’ and ‘how’, but basically can be described as a search for patterns [[20220415246200]] of lexical or grammatical features (@Bennett2010).

Like other fields, such as cultural analytics [[20220415229000]], cliometrics [[20220415226200]] and computational linguistics [[20220415227100]], it is considered as a ‘neighboring’ discipline [[20220415232500]] of DH [[20220415230900]] with shared methodology [[20220418210120]]. However, the boundaries between the methodological framework of the one and the methodological framework of the other are still questionable.
