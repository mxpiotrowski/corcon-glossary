[[20220415228300]] corpus

Even though it is not fully clear on whether it is a methodology or a scientific discipline in its own right, most will agree that CL [] is based on the analysis of corpora [] which are collections of naturally occurring examples of language a.k.a. texts (@ ). The notion of corpus [] plays a key role, as it serves as the scientific object for every study conducted within the field. However, most of the focus is placed on the computational methods that study the corpus and not the corpus itself, as a model of the phenomenon it illustrates. 

In our understanding, CL [] consist of the application of formal modeling in a set of predefined items, guided by a set of rules or criteria for the selection, as well as the analysis of these items. The concept of formal modeling helps us to understand the quantitative nature of the research conducted on corpora, a research that is not concerned with questions of ‘why’ and ‘how’, but basically can be described as a search for patterns of lexical or grammatical features (@ ).

Like other fields, such as cultural analytics [], cliometrics [] and computational linguistics [], it is considered as a ‘neighboring’ discipline of DH []. However, the boundaries between the methodological framework of the one and the methodological framework of the other are still questionable.
