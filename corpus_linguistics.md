According to Ludeling and Kyto, modern [[20220616094612]] corpus linguistics can be broadly defined as follows:
 
> Corpus linguistics today is often understood as being a relatively new approach in linguistics that has to do with the empirical study of “real life” language use with the help of computers and electronic corpora. In the first instance, a “corpus” is simply any collection of written or spoken texts. However, when the term is employed with reference to modern linguistics, it tends to bear a number of connotations, among them machine-readable form, sampling and representativeness, finite size, and the idea that a corpus constitutes a standard reference for the language variety it represents.

As they mention, the current form of [[20220616094612]] corpus linguistics is attributed to the _historical linguistics_. They argue, that the methods used for the analysis of the [[20220415228300]] corpus (one of the basic components of corpus linguistics research) predates those of its systematic [[20220415232400]] digitization:

> One of the main contributors to modern corpus linguistics is the area of comparative and historical linguistics, the reason being, of course, that historical linguists have always made use of texts or text collections as their material. Many techniques developed in the nineteenth century for reconstructing older languages or recognizing relationships between languages are still in use today.

and,

> Many techniques that are in use in corpus linguistics are much older than computers: many of them are rooted in the tradition of the late eighteenth and nineteenth century when linguistics was for the first time claimed to be a “real”, or empirical, science.

[[20220616094612]] Corpus linguistics exploits many different methods to study [[20220415228300]] corpora, such as parts-of-speech extraction, syntactic and semantic analysis, data annotation etc. The [[20220415223600]] annotation process is considered to be one of the most quintessential methods used today. Ludeling states about this method: 

> Annotation is an explicit categorization of data according to a predetermined, ideally deterministically decidable scheme (see Lüdeling 2011 for more on annotation). Most straightforward is the use of annotations as an index for finding all cases of a certain category. But the real potential of annotations in offering new insight is when they are combined to find environments that correspond to relevant phenomena in forms not previously thought of.

In [[20220616094612]] corpus linguistics, the objectives of the respective research carried out within the field’s framework determine the design and construction of the [[20220415228300]] corpus itself. Samples are widely used for the obvious reason that finite populations of [[20220415253200]] texts are very rare and, in many cases, unreliable in terms of the criteria used for their construction:

> Ideally, the research question determines the data to be used, so that all variables can be controlled. A corpus is almost always a sample of the linguistic variety to be analysed. Only in very few cases – when the entire population is finite, small and accessible – is it possible to work without sampling. If, for example, one wanted to analyse all of Nobel’s letters to his mistress it could, in principle, be possible to take all of them (if they were available). But usually the linguistic variety to be analysed is too large to be completely analysed and one has to take a sample.
-@Ludeling2011 [226]

The corpus type also plays an important role in the selection and the analysis. Generally speaking:

> Corpora range in type from general, reference corpora designed to investigate a given language as a whole, to specialised corpora designed to answer more specific research questions. They can be carefully planned and have a long ‘shelf-life’, or they can be ‘disposable’ (Bernardini/Baroni 2004), quickly constructed for a specific purpose and as rapidly discarded.
-@Ludeling2008 [154]

As an interdisciplinary field, [[20220616094612]] corpus linguistics is closely-connected with [[20220415227100]] computational linguistics, in terms of its methodology. As Dipper points out in one of her articles:

> Computational linguistics and corpus linguistics are closely-related disciplines: they both exploit electronic corpora, extract various kinds of linguistic information from them, and make use of the same methods to acquire this information.
-@Dipper2008a

She adds, that [[20220616094612]] corpus linguistics overlap with the corpus-driven branch of [[20220415227100]] computational linguistics. More specifically: 

> Obviously, the corpus-driven branch of computational linguistics has a natural affinity to corpus linguistics, and a shared interest in corpus exploitation. As a consequence, many research topics can be attributed equally well to either computational linguistics or corpus linguistics; examples include part-of-speech tagging (see article 25), treebanking (article 17), semantic tagging (article 27), coreference resolution (article 28), to name just a few.
-@Dipper2008a

All the above mentioned verify that [[20220616094612]] corpus linguistics correspond to a branch of knowledge with shared (with other [[20220415232500]] disciplines) methodology and individually-shaped research expectations.
