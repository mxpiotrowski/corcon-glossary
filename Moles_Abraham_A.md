Abraham Moles (* August 19, 1920 in Touzac, † May 22, 1992 in Strasbourg) was a pioneer in information science and communication studies in France.  He was a professor at the Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm and the Université de Strasbourg.

For us, it is in particular his book *Les sciences de l’imprécis* [@Moles1995] that is relevant.  Moles worked with [[20231226211230]] Max Bense at the HfG Ulm.  His second PhD (in philosophy) was supervised by [[20220415224900]] Gaston Bachelard.
