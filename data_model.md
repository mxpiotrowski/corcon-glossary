[[20220415222800]] Abstract model which organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

> Much of the information in an information system is about relationships.  However, most data models (e.g., the relational model, IMS hierarchies, DBTG networks) do not provide a direct way to describe such relationships, but provide instead a variety of representational techniques (record formats, data structures).  Implicit in most of these, and in the accompanying restrictions in the data processing system, is the ability to support some forms of relationships very well, some rather clumsily, and some not at all.

(Cf. RDF, description logic, etc.)

This is compatible with my (MP) view that “data modeling” is more about “massaging” data so that it fits some *modeling framework* (a provisional term that I’m using in teaching, but haven’t defined yet).

> One thing we ought to have clear in our minds at the outset of a modelling endeavor is whether we are intent on describing a portion of “reality” (some human enterprise), or a data processing activity.

> Most models describe data processing activities, not human enterprises.

> The pretend to describe entity types, but the vocabulary is from data processing: fields, data items, values.  Naming rules don’t reflect the conventions we use fore naming people and things; they reflect instead tecvhniques for locating records in files.
