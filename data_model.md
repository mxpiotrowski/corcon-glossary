[[20220415222800]] Abstract model which organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

> Much of the information in an information system is about relationships.  However, most data models (e.g., the relational model, IMS hierarchies, DBTG networks) do not provide a direct way to describe such relationships, but provide instead a variety of representational techniques (record formats, data structures).  Implicit in most of these, and in the accompanying restrictions in the data processing system, is the ability to support some forms of relationships very well, some rather clumsily, and some not at all.

(Cf. RDF, description logic, etc.)

This is compatible with my (MP) view that “data modeling” is more about “massaging” data so that it fits some *modeling framework* (a provisional term that I’m using in teaching, but haven’t defined yet).
