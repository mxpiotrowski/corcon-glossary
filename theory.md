Notes MP:

There seems to be a general consensus that there is a relation between theories and [[20220415244100]] models; however, there seems to be no widespread agreement about what this relation is, or even what exactly the difference between a model and a theory is.

In the following quote Weizenbaum implicitly (IIRC) draws on the notions of *model* and *theory* from *mathematical* model theory.  This is not necessarily bad—especially given Weizenbaum’s example of a pendulum—and a good starting point, but one has to remember that mathematical model theory simplifies things *a lot*, to the point that one could argue that it is really just a terminological similarity (e.g., mathematical theory is not concerned with “real” originals).

> The connection between a model and a theory is that a model *satisfies* a theory; that is, a model obeys those laws of behavior that a corresponding theory explicitly states or which may be derived from it. […]
>
> Computers make possible an entirely new relationship between theories and models. […] Theories written in the form of computer programs are ordinary theories as seen from one point of view. […] A theory written in the form of a computer program is thus both a theory and, when placed on a computer and run, a model to which the theory applies.
