"problème d’une méthodologie de l’imprécis: concrétiser ou de proposer des définitions ouvertes pour des concepts" [@Moles1995]

"A concept has become scientific according to the proportion to which it has become technical, to which it is accompanied by a technique of realization” (Bachelard [1938] 1969, p. 61). [@Rheinberger2005, 320-321]
"In The Formation of the Scientiac Spirit, Bachelard formulates quite expressly: “In order to accommodate new experimental proofs, one must . . . deform the primitive concepts. One must not only study the conditions of application of these concepts, but one must incorporate the conditions of application of a concept into the very meaning of the concept itself” (Bachelard [1938] 1969, p. 61). [@Rheinberger2005, 324]
