An abstract or generic [[20220616094622]] idea generalized from particular instances. 

This resonates with Pliny the Elder's account of how Greek authors attempted to delineate plants in colors (Naturalis Historia, 25.4):

> In addition to these [Romans], there are some Greek writers who have treated of this subject, and who have been already mentioned on the appropriate occasions. Among them, Crateuas, Dionysius, and Metrodorus, adopted a very attractive method of description, though one which has done little more than prove the remarkable difficulties which attended it. It was their plan to delineate the various plants in colours, and then to add in writing a description of the properties which they possessed. Pictures, however, are very apt to mislead, and more particularly where such a number of tints is required, for the imitation of nature with any success; in addition to which, the diversity of copyists from the original paintings, and their comparative degrees of skill, add very considerably to the chances of losing the necessary degree of resemblance to the originals. And then, besides, it is not sufficient to delineate a plant as it appears at one period only, as it presents a different appearance at each of the four seasons of the year.

The concept of a certain plant, a sunflower for example, is generalized from its particular instances.

According to Aristotle (Metaphysica, 7.1036a):

> The question naturally presents itself, what sort of parts belong to the form and what sort belong not to it but to the concrete object. Yet if this is not plain it is impossible to define the particular; because the definition refers to the universal and the form. Therefore if it is not clear what kind of parts are material and what kind are not, the formula of the thing will not be clear either.
—@Aristotle2003

Notes: concepts in Dewey's sense, i.e., as cognitive tools to handle the world and solve problems.

"A concept has become scientific according to the proportion to which it has become technical, to which it is accompanied by a technique of realization” (Bachelard [1938] 1969, p. 61). [@Rheinberger2005, 320-321]
"In The Formation of the Scientiac Spirit, Bachelard formulates quite expressly: “In order to accommodate new experimental proofs, one must . . . deform the primitive concepts. One must not only study the conditions of application of these concepts, but one must incorporate the conditions of application of a concept into the very meaning of the concept itself” (Bachelard [1938] 1969, p. 61).
