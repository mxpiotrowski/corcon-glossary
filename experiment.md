Moles [for a summary, see @Moles1995, 277] distinguishes between experiment, [[20220616094631]] observation, and [[20220415251200]] simulation, which differ in the degree of interaction between the researcher and the phenomenon under study: *interaction forte*, *interaction faible*, and what we might call (but it seems Moles doesn't use the term) *interaction nulle*. 

Thus, in history (as in almost all of the humanities), no experiments in this sense are possible.
