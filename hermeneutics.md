"Term applied, in the most general sense, to the practice and theory of interpretation. The word is derived from the name of the Greek god Hermes, the divine messenger. The objects of hermeneutics are primarily spoken utterances and written texts, especially those that appear obscure or are presumed to convey a hidden message, but the term is very broadly used. Every human product, from individual works of visual art to whole social and cultural systems, can be subject to interpretation."
