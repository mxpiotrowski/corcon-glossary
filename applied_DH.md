One of the two parts of Piotrowski’s “double definition” of [[20220415230900]] digital humanities [@Piotrowski2018a; @Piotrowski2018d].

We use the term *applied digital humanities* to designate the construction of [[20220415227300]] computational models in the [[20220415238200]] humanities disciplines [@Piotrowski2018a].

As they have the same research objects and the same research objectives, applied digital humanities, e.g., [[20220415230800]] digital history or computational literary studies, are subfields of their mother [[20220415232500]] disciplines.  This is in contrast to [[20220415253800]] *theoretical digital humanities*, which studies the general properties of such models at a higher level of abstraction.

@Piotrowski2020b states (note that this passage is not perfect):

> The term *applied computational humanities* refers to those fields of research which, like digital history or digital literary studies, for example, fall within a humanities discipline and have as their object the construction of formal models of the phenomena studied by this “parent discipline,” as well as the methodology of this construction.  The difference between the “traditional” and “digital” therefore relates specifically to the nature of the models they aim to construct: in the case of the latter, they are *formal* models that can be manipulated by computers.  In all other respects, they share the research objects and objectives of the humanities disciplines to which they belong.  In particular, computational research must meet all the quality and relevance criteria of these disciplines—it goes without saying that no relaxation of these criteria can be justified by the use of particular methods and tools.

(@Piotrowski2020b uses the term [[20220616094610]] *computational humanities*, but this distinction is irrelevant here.)

**Note:** I have called digital history, etc., “subfields of their mother disciplines.”  This is perhaps not the right term, as I would consider a subfield rather a specialization on a specific research object or research objective of the larger discipline, for example educational psychology as a [Subfield of psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfields_of_psychology).  However, digital history is a specific methodological *approach*, orthogonal to the research objects and objectives of history, i.e., unlike, say medieval history or animal history.  [TODO] Update the description above in this sense.
