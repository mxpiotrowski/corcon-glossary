Radical constructivism is an approach to [[20220415234300]] epistemology that situates [[20220415240700]] knowledge in terms of knowers' experience.  It looks to break with the conception of knowledge as a correspondence between a knower's understanding of their experience and the world beyond that experience.  Adopting a sceptical position towards correspondence as in principle impossible to verify because one cannot access the world beyond one's experience in order to test the relation, radical constructivists look to redefine epistemology in terms of the *viability* [@vonGlasersfeld2005] of knowledge within knowers' experience.  This break from the traditional framing of epistemology differentiates it from “trivial” forms of constructivism that emphasise the role of the knower in constructing knowledge while maintaining the traditional perspective of knowledge in terms of correspondence.  Radical constructivism has been described as a “post-epistemological” position.

Radical constructivism was initially formulated by Ernst von Glasersfeld, who drew on the work of Jean Piaget, Giambattista Vico, and George Berkeley amongst others.  Radical constructivism is closely related to second-order cybernetics, and especially the work of Heinz von Foerster, Humberto Maturana, and Francisco Varela.

Radical constructivism has been influential in educational research and the [[20220415247100]] philosophy of science.

The above entry is a placeholder, slightly adapted from [Radical constructivism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_constructivism).  For *viability* the Wikipedia entry refers to Glasersfeld, E. von (1980). Viability and the concept of selection. American Psychologist, 35(11), 970-974. <http://www.vonglasersfeld.com/060>, which may be the first mention of this concept by von Glasersfeld, but its epistemological notion is only hinted at in a note :

> The concept of  *viability* is a promising tool also in the philosophy of science. The idea that scientific theories and knowledge in general should be considered viable or unviable rather than true or *false* (von Glasersfeld, Note 3) seems to be compatible with recent developments in epistemology (e.g., Feyerabend, 1975; Kuhn, 1970).

[The reference to “Note 3” is unclear; it refers neither to the preceding note nor to an entry in the bibliography.  This would need to be checked in the published version.]
