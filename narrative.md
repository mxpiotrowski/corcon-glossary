> The modern narrative, in its own way, is as much a substitute for myth as are the natural and human sciences. As Peter Brooks points out, in the last century and in Western culture “the making and the interpretation of narrative plots assumes a centrality and importance in literature, and in life, that they did not have earlier, no doubt because of a large movement of human societies out from under the mantle of sacred myth into the modern world where men and institutions are more and more defined by their shape in time.”
