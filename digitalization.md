[[20220415232400]] Digitization and digitalization are often used interchangeably.  We follow @Brennen2016’s argument that there is analytical value in explicitly making a clear distinction between these two terms.

@Brennen2016 define

> digitization as the material process of converting analog streams of information into digital bits. In contrast, we refer to digitalization as the way many domains of social life are restructured around digital communication and media infrastructures.  
—@Brennen2016 [1]

Thus, digitization is the prerequisite for digitalization, but digitization does not necessarily lead to digitalization.  For example, replacing paper forms with PDF forms would digitize a administrative workflow, but almost all other aspects of the workflow could remain unchanged—and often do.  Digitalization would restructure the workflow to take advantage of the possibilities offered by digitization and computation.  If the form was, say, used to reserve a room (via a secretary who would note the reservation in a list and put a sign on the room), digitalization could mean replacing this process with an application in which users could search for free rooms and reserve them with a click.  The information would be stored in a database (and thus be available for the next request) and could be transmitted to other systems, such as information screens.

In humanities research, a digitized manuscript (a digital facsimile) has many practical advantages, e.g., allowing scholars to consult it at any time and from anywhere.  Apart from this, however, the research process does not change.
