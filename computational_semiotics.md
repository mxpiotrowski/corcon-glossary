> In short, new computer technologies are changing semiotic enquiry in one way or another.  They open up a spacial type of scientific enquiry – not because they are technologies, but because they rest upon [[20220415227300]] computational and [[20220415235200]] formal models which themselves relate in some way or another to conceptual models that are most of the time the mainstay of semiotics.

> In no way then should computational semiotics be understood as *automatic* semiotics, but rather as *computer-assisted* semiotics.  And classical interpretation will always remain the core of semiotic [[20220616094603]] analysis.  Meanings may be processed by all living beings, but semiotics is a specific type of semiosis: it is essentially a human affair.  And for discovering, explaining and understanding this meaning, Hermes may now have efficient oracles as assistant.
