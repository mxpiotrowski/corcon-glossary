In neuropsychology, linguistics and the philosophy of language, a natural language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through the use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing. They are distinguished from constructed and formal languages, such as those used to program computers or to study logic.
