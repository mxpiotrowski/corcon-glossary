Humans have limited knowledge and limited perception.  Models are thus essential to explain how the world works.  When we try to understand what is happening, we make a model of the part of the world we are interested in and use that model in lieu of the real system to understand what is happening through simulation or causal analysis of the processes involved.  In our mental models, none of this is explicit.  An important aspect of science is to create explicit, intersubjective models:

> The choice, then, is not whether to build models; it's whether to build explicit ones.  In explicit models, assumptions are laid out in detail, so we can study exactly what they entail.  On these assumptions, this sort of thing happens.  When you alter the assumptions that is what happens.  By writing explicit models, you let others replicate your results.  
—@Epstein2008

This applies to all discipline.  However, in contrast to the natural sciences, models in the humanities are traditionally *not formal* and only partially explicit.

One of the first modern attempt at a definition of *model* is by [[20220617235759]] Leo Apostel:

> […] *any subject using a system A that is neither directly nor indirectly interacting with a system B to obtain information about the system B*, is using A as a model for B.  
—@Apostel1961 [36]

It is remarkable because of its generality and because it already contains the notion that we have a *three-valued* relation between [[20220616094633]] original, subject, and model.  Klaus Dieter Wüstneck makes this explicit:

> Wenn z. B. das Modell nur als [[20220616094637]] Abbildung, Reproduktion, [[20220616094624]] Imitation eines bestimmten Originals aufgefaßt wird, so ist das eine notwendige, aber keine hinreichende Charakterisierung der Situation, denn das erklärt zwar z. T. das Verhältnis des Modells zum Original, aber nicht seine Funktion im Gesamtprozeß, bei dem immer eine dritte Komponente beteiligt ist: das *Modellsubjekt*. […]
>
> *Folglich gehört es zum Wesen des Modellbegriffs, daß eine Relation zwischen drei Komponenten vorliegt, daß das Modell als solches nur in bezug auf ein bestimmtes Original und ein bestimmtes «Subjekt» definiert werden kann.*
—@Wuestneck1963 [1514-1515]

However, although crucial, the subject is often forgotten or merely implied.  For example, Viktor Štoff’s definition mentions *us* (the model user), but only in passing:

> Под моделью понимается такая мысленно представляемая или материально реализованная система, которая, отображая или воспроизводя объект исследования, способна замещать его так, что ее изучение дает нам новую информацию об этом объекте.  
—@Stoff1966 [19]

> Unter einem Modell wird ein ideell vorgestelltes oder materiell realisiertes System verstanden, das das Forschungsobjekt widerspiegelt oder reproduziert und es so zu vertreten vermag, daß uns sein Studium neue Information über dieses Objekt vermittelt.  
—@Stoff1969 [32]
{lang=de}

In fact, a model is only a model of an original because *someone* considers it as such.

In his *Allgemeine Modelltheorie*, [[20220415252000]] Herbert Stachowiak postulates three fundamental properties of models [@Stachowiak1973, 131]:

- **Mapping**: (Abbildungsmerkmal) Models are always models *of something*, viz., mappings from, representations of natural or artificial [[20220616094633]] originals, which can themselves be models.
- **Reduction**: (Verkürzungsmerkmal) Models generally *do not capture all attributes* of the original they represent, but only those that seem relevant to the model creators and/or model users.
- **Pragmatism**: (Pragmatisches Merkmal) Models are *not per se uniquely assigned* to their originals. They fulfill their replacement function
    - for particular—cognitive and/or acting—subjects that use the model,
    - within particular time intervals, and
    - restricted to particular mental or actual operations.

Stachowiak makes it clear that originals can be anything:

> Solche Originale können auf natürliche Weise entstanden, technisch hergestellt oder sonstwie gegeben sein. Sie können dem Bereich der [[20220616094640]] Symbole, der [[20220616094623]] Welt der Vorstellungen und der [[20220415227900]] Begriffe oder der physischen Wirklichkeit angehören. Als (materiell-)energetische Objekte können sie raum-zeitliche Vorgänge oder räumliche Konfigurationen darstellen. Sie können durch natürliche oder maschinelle Informationsverarbeiter [[20220415246400]] perzipiert oder, unabhängig von momentaner Perzeption, in zentral-operationalen Prozessen aufgebaut sein. Oberhaupt jede von einem natürlichen oder maschinellen [[20220616094609]] kognitiven Subjekt erfahrbare, allgemeiner: «erstellbare» [[20220616094614]] Entität kann in diesem umfassenden Sinn als Original eines oder mehrerer Modelle aufgefaßt werden.

The model concept was never static:

> as far as we know, the word “model” only began to be increasingly used since the Italian Renaissance, originating in architecture. At the time, it was interpreted similarly to today’s understanding of the words “illustration,” “example,” or “replica” (Müller 1980, pp. 205–06). According to Max Jammer, “model” only began to be used as a special scientific term (“terminus technicus”) starting in the mid-nineteenth century. But he notes that we can find precursors of this development as early as the emergence of modern science around 1600.
—@Hof2018 [78]

Hof outlines the long history of the creation and use of models as follows:
- the empirical *mechanical model* (from about 1600 onwards)
- the model's function of simplification gained importance (end of the nineteenth century)
- the mathematical *formal model* (first third of the twentieth century)
- functional *models as concrete entities*, constructed for epistemic purposes (mid-twentieth century)
- models viewed as comparable to cognitive aids (starting with the cognitive turn around 1970)

Notes on etymology:
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/modulus#Latin

According to @Buethe2002 [482]: "a schematic statement of a theoretical argument, a hypothesized parsimonious abstraction or simplification of “reality” that depicts a deductively sound, systematic, regular relationship between specified aspects of reality and helps to explain that relationship."
According to @Moles1995‌: "simulacre." He also notes: model = didactic (dynamic, not anatomique), and that "[Expliquer n’est plus analyser, c’est construire un modèle.]{lang=fr}"

According to @Stachowiak1973 [56]: "[Hiernach ist alle Erkenntnis Erkenntnis in Modellen oder durch Modelle, und jegliche menschliche Weltbegegnung überhaupt bedarf des Mediums 'Modell']{lang=de}"
According to Suzanne [@Bachelard1979, 3]: "[un intermédiaire à qui nous déléguons la fonction de connaissance, plus précisément de réduction de l’encore-énigmatique, en présence d’un champ d’études dont l’accès, pour des raisons diverses, nous est difficile]{lang=fr}."

[TODO] @Frigg2022 (I’ve just browsed Sect. 14 “What Are Models?” and at first sight, I don’t find the discussion convincing; it may nevertheless be useful as a counterpoint.  It may also be useful wrt. the relation between [[20220415254000]] theories and models, which is a question I haven’t really looked into yet.)

Note MP:

[TODO] @Russell2010 [13] summarize @Craik1943 [50]:

> Craik specified the three key setps of a knowledge-based agent: (1) the stimulus must be translated into an internal representation, (2) the representation is émanipulated by cognitive processes to derive new internal representations, and (3) these are in turn retranslated back into action.

They then quote him:

> If the organism carries a “small-scale” model of external reality and of its own possible actions within its head, it is able to try out various alternatives, conclude which is the best of them, react to future situations before they arise, utilise the knowledge of past events in dealing with the present and future, and in every way to react in a much fuller, safer, and more competent manner to the emergencies which face it.  
—@Craik1943 [61]

This corresponds quite well to the modeling triad.  The book seems to be generally quite interesting wrt. to the notion of model.  For the moment, here’s the rest of the passage:

> Most of the great advances of modern technology have been instruments which extended the scope of our sense-organs, our brains or our limbs.  Such are telescopes and microscopes, wireless, calculating machines, typewriters, motor cars, ships and aeroplanes.  Is it not possible, therefore, that our brains themselves utilise comparable mechanisms to achieve the same ends and that these mechanisms can parallel phenomena in the external world as a calculating machine can parallel the development of strains in a bridge?  
—@Craik1943 [61]

On page 51ff, he attempts to define model:

> Surely, however, this process of prediction is not unique to minds, though no doubt it is hard to imitate the flexibility and versatility of mental prediction.  A calculating machine, an anti-aircraft “predictor,” and Kelvin’s tidal predictor all show the same ability.  In all these latter cases, the physical process which it is desired to predict is *imitated* by some mechanical device or model which is cheaper, or quicker, or more convenient in operation.  Here we have a very close parallel to our three stages of reasoning—the “translation” of the external processes into their representatives (positions of gears, etc.) in the model; the arrival at other positions of gears, etc., by mechanical processes in the instrument; and finally, the retranslation of these into physical processes of the original type.
>
> By a model we thus mean any physical or chemical system which has a similar relation-structure to that of the process it imitates.  By “relation-structure” I do not mean some obscure non-physical entity which works in the same way as the process it parallels, in the aspects under consideration at any moment.  Thus, the model need not resemble the real object pictorially; Kelvin’s tide-predictor, which consists of a number of pulleys on levers, does not resemble a tide in appearance, but it works in the same way in certain essential respects—it combines oscillations of various frequencies so as to produce an oscillation which closely resembles in amplitude at each moment the variation in tide level at any place.  Again, since the physical object is “translated” into a working model which gives a prediction which is retranslated into terms of the original object, we cannot say that the model invariably either precedes or succeeds the external object it models.  The only logical distinction is on the ground of cheapness, speed, and convenience.  
—@Craik1943 [51–52]

> Any kind of working model of a process is, in a sense, an analogy.  Being different it is bound somewhere to break down by showiing properties not found in the process it imitates or by not possessing properties possessed by the process it imitates.  Perhaps the extraordinary pervasiveness of number, and the multiplicity of operations which can be performed on number without leading to inconsistency, is not a proof of the “real exsistence” of numbers as such but a proof of the extreme flexibility of the neural model or calculating machine.  This flexibility renders a far greater number of operations possible for it than for any other single process or model.
