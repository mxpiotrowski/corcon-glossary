Apparently @Cukier2013 do not have coined the term *datafication*, but they have certainly contributed to its popularization.  According to the authors, datafication refers to the trend of “taking all aspects of life and turning them into [[20220415229300]] data” [@Cukier2013, 35]:

> [[20220415225000]] Big data is also characterized by the ability to render into data many aspects of the world that have never been quantified before; call it “datafication.”  For example, location has been datafied, first with the invention of longitude and latitude, and more recently with GPS satellite systems.  Words are treated as data when computers mine centuries' worth of books.  Even friendships and "likes" are datafied, via Facebook.

As the examples show, datafication implies [[20220616094626]] measurement, but does not necessarily mean [[20220415248700]] quantification; however, quantification often follows.  For example, the geolocation of a person is not quantitative information.  It can be used for qualitative analyses, e.g., for determining proximity to other entities.  Nevertheless, an important use of such data is to keep track of the frequency of visits to this location, from which then preferences and habits can be inferred.

@Cukier2013 stress that datafication is *not* the same as [[20220415232400]] digitization:

> Datafication is not the same as digitization, which takes analog content—books, films, photographs—and converts it into digital information, a sequence of ones and zeros that computers can read.  Datafication is a far broader activity: taking all aspects of life and turning them into data.  […] Once we datafy things, we can transform their purpose and turn the information into new forms of value.

Datafication can thus be seen as an aspect of [[20220415231600]] digitalization.  For example, location-based services do away with the need to specify one’s location.

@Lycett2013 [383] calls datafication “an information technology driven *sense-making process*,” with “sense-making” referring to “processes of organising using the technology of language (e.g., labelling and categorising) to identify and regularise memories into plausible explanations and whole [[20220616094627]] narratives.”

As @Lycett2013 points out, 

> it should be clear that datafication will unavoidably omit many features of the world, distort others and potentially add features that are not apparent in the first instance.  
—@Lycett2013 [384]

Note that these are characteristics of [[20220415244100]] models, and of course datafication is ultimately about building models.  An important point in this respect is that these models are based on correlation rather than [[20220415225700]] causation:

> Big data is poised to reshape the way we live, work, and think.  A worldview built on the importance of causation is being challenged by a preponderance of correlations.  The possession of knowledge, which once meant an understanding of the past, is coming to mean an ability to predict the future.  The challenges posed by big data will not be easy to resolve. Rather, they are simply the next step in the timeless debate over how to best understand the world.
