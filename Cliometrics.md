Method of applying formal economic models and econometric analysis to [[20220415237900]] historical trends and events. Cliometrics revolutionized the study of economic history and stands in contrast to prior methods of economic history, which tend to rely on qualitative, interpretive and narrative methods.

MP: Referring to @Diebolt2011, @Gauthier2022 [293] defines *cliometrics* as “an auxiliary field of economics that applies econometrics and economic theory to the data elaborated by historical economics,” with historical economics being “concerned with the study of past economic events” [@Gauthier2022, 292].  If, according to Gauthier, the relation between cliometrics and historical economics is that the latter supplies the data for the former, it does not really make much sense when he notes that “[c]liometrics and historical economics are not synonymous, but they are close” [@Gauthier2022, 292].  One “critical difference” between the two fields [again, according to @Gauthier2022, 293] is that “the latter has been tackled by historians as well as by economists, while cliometrics has tended to remain the territory of economists due to the field’s greater focus on quantitative measurements.”

Also when he talks about [[20220415226100]] cliodynamics and quantitative [[20220415237900]] history, the most important difference for Gauthier seems to be *who* is doing it:

> In a separate domain, *quantitative history* is the application of quantitative methods (such as statistical analysis or modeling, network analysis, or big data processing) to history, by historians. Quantitative history grew from historical economics (and evolved as a separate field as statistical methods were introduced in order to account for growing historical economic and demographic data) in the middle of the twentieth century. Although quantitative history may be commingled with cliodynamics (as cliodynamicians may describe their own endeavor as quantitative history), I will consider it a fundamentally different field because it is carried out by historians.

In contrast, “cliodynamicians” tend to be “physicists, biologists, and mathematicians”—which is certainly true.

More interesting is his proposal that “this whole space between economics and history could be termed clionomics because it is essentially nomothetic” [@Gauthier2022, 290].  He argues that this is the reason why “it cannot be integrated by historical method and thus remains separated from history.”
