He invented a philosophical system known as the  *Art*, conceived as a type of universal logic to prove the truth of Christian doctrine to interlocutors of all faiths and nationalities. He is considered as one of the fathers of Catalan literature and he is thought to be the first to use a vernacular language to express philosophical, scientific, and technical ideas.
