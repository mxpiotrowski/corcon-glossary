                  are the interconnections between academic cultures and the
                  nature of disciplines? Academic Tribes and Territories maps
                  academic knowledge and explores the diverse characteristics
                  of those who inhabit and cultivate it. This second edition
                  provides a thorough update to Tony Becher's classic text,
                  first published in 1989, and incorporates research findings
                  and new theoretical perspectives. Fundamental changes in the
                  nature of higher education and in the academic's role are
                  reviewed and their significance for academic cultures is
                  assessed. This edition moves beyond the first edition's focus
                  on elite universities and the research role to examine
                  academic cultures in lower status institutions
                  internationally and to place a new emphasis on issues of
                  gender and ethnicity. This second edition successfully renews

  abstract =     {Although corpus-based analyses of linguistic variation have
                  provided fresh insights into previously intractable issues,
                  several methodological criticisms have been raised about the
                  overall design of text corpora and the validity of text
                  'genres' as a basis for analyses of variation. Unfortunately,
                  most of these criticisms have been based on intuitive
                  judgements rather than empirical investigation. The present
                  study begins to correct this lack of evidence concerning
                  these issues It focuses on four particular methodological
                  issues. (1) how long texts should be in order to reliably
                  represent the distribution of linguistic features in
                  particular text categories; (2) how many texts within each
                  text category are required in order to reliablity represent
                  the linguistic characteristics of that category, and related
                  questions concerning the validity of 'genre'categories, (3)
                  how many texts are needed in a corpus to accurately identify
                  the salient parameters of linguistic variation among texts;
                  and (4) how much of a cross-section is required to identify
                  and analyze the salient parameters of variation among texts
                  These issues are addressed through statistical investigation
                  of the distribution of linguistic features across various
                  sub-samples of the {LOB} and {London-Lond} corpora, in
                  comparison to their distribution across the full corpora. The
                  results indicate that existing corpora are adequate for many
                  analyses of linguistic variation, In conclusion, the paper
                  welcomes the future availablity of larger and more
                  representative corpora, but it also urges researches to fully
                  exploit existing corpora for ongoing investigations of
                  linguistic variation.},

                  achieving representativeness' in linguistic corpus design,
                  including: discussion of what it means to represent' a
                  language, definition of the target population, stratified
                  versus proportional sampling of a language, sampling within
                  texts, and issues relating to the required sample size
                  (number of texts) of a corpus. The paper distinguishes among
                  various ways that linguistic features can be distributed
                  within and across texts; it analyses the distributions of
                  several particular features, and it discusses the
                  implications of these distributions for corpus design. The
                  paper argues that theoretical research should be prior in
                  corpus design, to identify the situational parameters that
                  distinguish among texts in a speech community, and to
                  identify the types of linguistic features that will be
                  analysed in the corpus. These theoretical considerations
                  should be complemented by empirical investigations of
                  linguistic variation in a pilot corpus of texts, as a basis
                  for specific sampling decisions. The actual construction of a
                  corpus would then proceed in cycles: the original design
                  based on theoretical and pilot-study analyses, followed by
                  collection of texts, followed by further empirical
                  investigations of linguistic variation and revision of the
                  design.},

                  transition from a specialty area to a full-fledged community
                  with a common set of methods, sources of evidence, and
                  infrastructure — all of which are necessary for achieving
                  academic recognition. As budgets are slashed and marginal
                  programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only
                  the most articulate and productive will survive. Digital
                  collections are proliferating, but most remain difficult to
                  use, and digital scholarship remains a backwater in most
                  humanities departments with respect to hiring, promotion, and
                  teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves are in a
                  position to move the field forward. Experiences of the
                  sciences in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and
                  eScience offer valuable lessons. Information- and
                  data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and
                  multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences,
                  while remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed
                  here are six factors for comparison, selected for their
                  implications for the future of digital scholarship in the
                  humanities: publication practices, data, research methods,
                  collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon lessons
                  gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are
                  “called to action” with five questions to address as a
                  community: What are data? What are the infrastructure
                  requirements? Where are the social studies of digital
                  humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st
                  century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities
                  in an era of declining budgets?},

                  historical processes can, indeed should, refuse the
                  choice between modeling causal relationships and
                  studying history. Identifying temporality as the
                  defining characteristic of processes that can be
                  meaningfully distinguished as ``history,'' I show
                  that modeling such phenomena engenders particular
                  difficulties but is both possible and
                  fruitful. Narratives, as a way of presenting
                  empirical information, have distinctive strengths
                  that make them especially suited for historical
                  scholarship, and structuring the narratives based on
                  the model allows us to treat them as data on which
                  to test the model. At the same time, this use of
                  narratives raises methodological problems not
                  identified in recent debates. I specify these
                  problems, analyze their implications, and suggest
                  ways of solving or minimizing them. There is no
                  inherent incompatibility between---but much
                  potential gain from---modeling history and using

                  modeling. One of these is that the goal is always prediction.
                  The lecture distinguishes between explanation and prediction
                  as modeling goals, and offers sixteen reasons other than
                  prediction to build a model. It also challenges the common
                  assumption that scientific theories arise from and
                  'summarize' data, when often, theories precede and guide data
                  collection; without theory, in other words, it is not clear
                  what data to collect. Among other things, it also argues that
                  the modeling enterprise enforces habits of mind essential to
                  freedom. It is based on the author's 2008 Bastille Day
                  keynote address to the Second World Congress on Social
                  Simulation, George Mason University, and earlier addresses at

  abstract =     {This essay will argue that the traditional opposition between
                  narrative and theory in historical sciences is dissolved if
                  we conceive of narratives as theoretical devices for
                  understanding events in time through special concepts that
                  abridge typical sequences of events. I shall stress, in the
                  context of the Historical Knowledge Epistemological Square
                  ({HKES}) that emerged with the scientization of history, that
                  history is always narrative, story has a theoretical ground
                  of itself, and scientific histories address the need for a
                  conceptual progression in ever‐improved narratives. This will
                  lead to identification of three major theoretical levels in
                  historical stories: naming, plotting (or emplotment), and
                  formalizing. We revisit Jörn Rüsen's theory of history as the
                  best starting point, and explore to what extent it could be
                  developed by (i) taking a deeper look into narratological
                  knowledge, and (ii) reanalyzing logically the conceptual
                  strata in order to bridge the overrated
                  {Forschung/Darstellung} (research/exposition) divide. The
                  corollary: we should consider (scientific) historical writing
                  as the last step of historical research, not as the next step
                  after research is over. This thesis will drive us to a
                  reconsideration of the German Historik regarding the problem
                  of interpretation and exposition. Far from alienating history
                  from science, narrative links history positively to
                  anthropology and biology. The crossing of our triad
                  name‐plot‐model with Rüsen's four theoretical levels
                  (categories‐types‐concepts‐names) points to the feasibility
                  of expanding Rüsen's Historik in logical and semiotic
                  directions. Story makes history, theory makes story, and
                  historical reason may proceed.},

                  knowledge. Implicitly or explicitly, digital humanities also
                  use models that allow them to position themselves as a
                  scientific inquiry. But this also limits and constrains their
                  method and application in the field of the humanities. At the

                  But it does more than that. Digitization also affects the

                  technology implement interpretative decisions that are not
                  without their effects on the semiotic text; that is to say,
                  the text that offers itself for reading and analysis. In this

                  du bouillonnement intellectuel des années 1960 :
                  les sciences humaines font éclater les cadres
                  reçus de l'interprétation. Le premier
                  mérite de Ricœur est de reprendre ce que
                  disent les sciences de l'homme pour mesurer comment
                  et pourquoi naît ce « conflit des
                  interprétations ».  On est loin ici d'une
                  philosophie se contentant de rappeler à hauts
                  cris le « sens » face à la « mort du sujet
                  ». S'il s'agit « d'explorer les voies ouvertes à
                  la philosophie contemporaine » par cette nouvelle
                  donne, il faut passer par le détour de l'analyse
                  longue, par l'exégèse de la Bible et les
                  disciplines religieuses, qui furent à l'origine
                  du problème herméneutique. Au terme de cette
                  analyse seulement, il sera possible à nouveau de
                  « donner un sens acceptable à la notion

                  everyday and essential practice in current academic
                  scholarship. The present article gives a concise overview of
                  approaches and methods within digital historical scholarship,
                  focusing on the question ‘How have the digital humanities
                  evolved and what has that evolution brought to historical
                  scholarship?’ We begin by discussing techniques in which data
                  are generated and machine searchable, such as OCR/HTR,
                  born-digital archives, computer vision, scholarly editions
                  and linked data. In the second section, we provide examples
                  of how data is made more accessible through quantitative text
                  and network analysis. The third section considers the need
                  for hermeneutics and data-awareness in digital historical
                  scholarship. The technologies described in this article have
                  had varying degrees of effect on historical scholarship,
                  usually in indirect ways. With this article we aim to take
                  stock of the digital approaches and methods used in
                  historical scholarship in order to provide starting points
                  for scholars seeking to understand the digital turn in the
                  field and how and when to implement such approaches in their

  abstract =	 {Digital humanities research has focused primarily on
                  the analysis of texts. This emphasis stems from the
                  availability of technology to study digitized
                  text. Optical character recognition allows
                  researchers to use keywords to search and analyze
                  digitized texts. However, archives of digitized
                  sources also contain large numbers of images. This
                  article shows how convolutional neural networks
                  ({CNNs}) can be used to categorize and analyze
                  digitized historical visual sources. We present
                  three different approaches to using {CNNs} for
                  gaining a deeper understanding of visual trends in
                  an archive of digitized Dutch newspapers. These
                  include detecting medium-specific features
                  (separating photographs from illustrations),
                  querying images based on abstract visual aspects
                  (clustering visually similar advertisements), and
                  training a neural network based on visual categories
                  developed by domain experts. We argue that {CNNs}
                  allow researchers to explore the visual side of the
                  digital turn. They allow archivists and researchers
                  to classify and spot trends in large collections of
                  digitized visual sources in radically new ways.},

  abstract =     {Digital humanities seem to be omnipresent these days
                  and the discipline of history is no exception. This
                  introduction is concerned with the changing practice
                  of 'doing' history in the digital age, seen within a
                  broader historical context of developments in the
                  digital humanities and 'digital history'. It argues
                  that there is too much emphasis on tools and data
                  while too little attention is being paid to how
                  doing history in the digital age is changing as a
                  result of the digital turn. This tendency towards
                  technological determinism needs to be balanced by
                  more attention to methodological and epistemological
                  considerations. The article offers a short survey of
                  history and computing since the 1960s with
                  particular attention given to the situation in the
                  Netherlands, considers various definitions of
                  'digital history' and argues for an integrative view
                  of historical practice in the digital age that
                  underscores hybridity as its main characteristic. It
                  then discusses some of the major changes in
                  historical practice before outlining the three major
                  themes that are explored by the various articles in
                  this thematic issue – digitisation and the archive,
                  digital historical analysis, and historical
                  knowledge (re)presentation and audiences.},
