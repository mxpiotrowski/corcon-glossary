                  own disciplines, and how do they rate those in other
                  subjects? How closely related are their intellectual tasks
                  and their ways of organizing their professional lives? What
                  are the interconnections between academic cultures and the
                  nature of disciplines? Academic Tribes and Territories maps
                  academic knowledge and explores the diverse characteristics
                  of those who inhabit and cultivate it. This second edition
                  provides a thorough update to Tony Becher's classic text,
                  first published in 1989, and incorporates research findings
                  and new theoretical perspectives. Fundamental changes in the
                  nature of higher education and in the academic's role are
                  reviewed and their significance for academic cultures is
                  assessed. This edition moves beyond the first edition's focus
                  on elite universities and the research role to examine
                  academic cultures in lower status institutions
                  internationally and to place a new emphasis on issues of
                  gender and ethnicity. This second edition successfully renews

  abstract =     {Although corpus-based analyses of linguistic variation have
                  provided fresh insights into previously intractable issues,
                  several methodological criticisms have been raised about the
                  overall design of text corpora and the validity of text
                  'genres' as a basis for analyses of variation. Unfortunately,
                  most of these criticisms have been based on intuitive
                  judgements rather than empirical investigation. The present
                  study begins to correct this lack of evidence concerning
                  these issues It focuses on four particular methodological
                  issues. (1) how long texts should be in order to reliably
                  represent the distribution of linguistic features in
                  particular text categories; (2) how many texts within each
                  text category are required in order to reliablity represent
                  the linguistic characteristics of that category, and related
                  questions concerning the validity of 'genre'categories, (3)
                  how many texts are needed in a corpus to accurately identify
                  the salient parameters of linguistic variation among texts;
                  and (4) how much of a cross-section is required to identify
                  and analyze the salient parameters of variation among texts
                  These issues are addressed through statistical investigation
                  of the distribution of linguistic features across various
                  sub-samples of the {LOB} and {London-Lond} corpora, in
                  comparison to their distribution across the full corpora. The
                  results indicate that existing corpora are adequate for many
                  analyses of linguistic variation, In conclusion, the paper
                  welcomes the future availablity of larger and more
                  representative corpora, but it also urges researches to fully
                  exploit existing corpora for ongoing investigations of
                  linguistic variation.},

                  achieving representativeness' in linguistic corpus design,
                  including: discussion of what it means to represent' a
                  language, definition of the target population, stratified
                  versus proportional sampling of a language, sampling within
                  texts, and issues relating to the required sample size
                  (number of texts) of a corpus. The paper distinguishes among
                  various ways that linguistic features can be distributed
                  within and across texts; it analyses the distributions of
                  several particular features, and it discusses the
                  implications of these distributions for corpus design. The
                  paper argues that theoretical research should be prior in
                  corpus design, to identify the situational parameters that
                  distinguish among texts in a speech community, and to
                  identify the types of linguistic features that will be
                  analysed in the corpus. These theoretical considerations
                  should be complemented by empirical investigations of
                  linguistic variation in a pilot corpus of texts, as a basis
                  for specific sampling decisions. The actual construction of a
                  corpus would then proceed in cycles: the original design
                  based on theoretical and pilot-study analyses, followed by
                  collection of texts, followed by further empirical
                  investigations of linguistic variation and revision of the
                  design.},

  subtitle =	 {Modeling History and the Use of Narratives as Evidence},
  abstract =	 {Social scientists interested in explaining
                  historical processes can, indeed should, refuse the
                  choice between modeling causal relationships and
                  studying history. Identifying temporality as the
                  defining characteristic of processes that can be
                  meaningfully distinguished as ``history,'' I show
                  that modeling such phenomena engenders particular
                  difficulties but is both possible and
                  fruitful. Narratives, as a way of presenting
                  empirical information, have distinctive strengths
                  that make them especially suited for historical
                  scholarship, and structuring the narratives based on
                  the model allows us to treat them as data on which
                  to test the model. At the same time, this use of
                  narratives raises methodological problems not
                  identified in recent debates. I specify these
                  problems, analyze their implications, and suggest
                  ways of solving or minimizing them. There is no
                  inherent incompatibility between---but much
                  potential gain from---modeling history and using
                  historical narratives as data.},

                  modeling. One of these is that the goal is always prediction.
                  The lecture distinguishes between explanation and prediction
                  as modeling goals, and offers sixteen reasons other than
                  prediction to build a model. It also challenges the common
                  assumption that scientific theories arise from and
                  'summarize' data, when often, theories precede and guide data
                  collection; without theory, in other words, it is not clear
                  what data to collect. Among other things, it also argues that
                  the modeling enterprise enforces habits of mind essential to
                  freedom. It is based on the author's 2008 Bastille Day
                  keynote address to the Second World Congress on Social
                  Simulation, George Mason University, and earlier addresses at

                  use models that allow them to position themselves as a

                  method and application in the field of the humanities. At the

  abstract =	 {Ces « essais d'herméneutique » portent la marque
                  du bouillonnement intellectuel des années 1960 :
                  les sciences humaines font éclater les cadres
                  reçus de l'interprétation. Le premier
                  mérite de Ricœur est de reprendre ce que
                  disent les sciences de l'homme pour mesurer comment
                  et pourquoi naît ce « conflit des
                  interprétations ».  On est loin ici d'une
                  philosophie se contentant de rappeler à hauts
                  cris le « sens » face à la « mort du sujet
                  ». S'il s'agit « d'explorer les voies ouvertes à
                  la philosophie contemporaine » par cette nouvelle
                  donne, il faut passer par le détour de l'analyse
                  longue, par l'exégèse de la Bible et les
                  disciplines religieuses, qui furent à l'origine
                  du problème herméneutique. Au terme de cette
                  analyse seulement, il sera possible à nouveau de
                  « donner un sens acceptable à la notion
                  d'existence ».},
