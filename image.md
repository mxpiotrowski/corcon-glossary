A [[20220616094637]] representation of a real or unreal world entity (a constructed [[20220415244100]] model of reality or [[20220616094623]] imagination).

"An image is a sign linked to another object, real or imaginary, by a stricter connection than is the case for arbitrary signs. This relation is called [[20220616094624]] mimetic. [...]
images are not limited solely to mimetic connections with their objects. They may often include: (i) signs with no mimetic aspect, such as frames, borders and inscriptions; (ii) mimetic signs functioning in an unusual capacity, such as attributes (thus a saint carrying an instrument of torture is not usually a torturer but a martyr); (iii) degenerated mimetic signs, such as aureoles, which bear only a distant relationship to the halo of light from which they derive."

Images: "a term which only began to be used in the West in the course of the Renaissance, and especially from the eighteenth century onwards, as the aesthetic function of images, at least in elite circles, began to dominate the many other uses of these objects." [@Burke2001, 16]
