[[isa:20220415232500]] Discipline concerned with the use of digital methods and application to the study of [[20220415237900]] history. It is considered as a branch of the [[20220415230900]] digital humanities and an extension of quantitative history, [[20220415226200]] cliometrics and [[20220415238300]] humanities computing. Digital history is commonly digital public history, concerned primarily with the engagement of online audiences with historical content, or digital research methods. Digital history outputs include: digital archives, online presentations, data visualizations, interactive maps and virtual worlds to make history more accessible and more interactive to the user.

> Though practiced by professional historians for decades, Digital History retains a modest presence in the broader arena of Digital Humanities and is noteworthy in its absence or limited place in recent major Digital Humanities publications.  Nor has Digital History rooted itself in the academy among the professional guild of historians.  In part the slow embrace of Digital History reflects concerns given voice in Brennan’s piece. The charges laid at the feet of Digital Humanities (and Digital History by extension) are similar to those made of quantitative- and social science historians during the culture-wars of the 1960s. In some ways, the circle has never been squared. For examples, social science historians have their own professional association and, among its ranks, the number of those practicing quantitative methods is dwindling. Many historians bristle when “data” are mentioned as objects of analysis; they work with “sources” or “evidence.” The quantitative element of Digital History is repellent to many historians and out of fashion in most fields of history, which rely in the main on case studies and qualitative approaches of interpretation. Thus, the “computational turn” embodied in Digital Humanities is already beyond the traditional norms of practice within the study of history.

Re digital historay and “the professional guild of historians,” see also @Laessig2021 [10]:

> In using the term digital history, then, historians aim to carve out a field that reflects their interest in accessing the digital space from the questions and issues raised in their field, that takes their specific types of primary sources and epistemology into account, and that uses digital technology to answer their research questions without becoming an end in itself.  New attempts to further define digital history arise again and again, yet almost all the protagonists share this aim.  Unlike computational linguists, who – partly because of the hesitation “armchair linguists” had shown – regarded themselves as members of an independent field in the 1960s and 1970s, most digital historians – like the authors of this special issue – see themselves as an integral part of the historians’ guild.
