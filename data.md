Draft definition as of 2022-12-07:

Data is a processable [[20220616094637]] representation of a [[20220415244100]] model of a [[20220415246700]] phenomenon.

--------

[[20220415234900]] Facts and [[20220415252400]] statistics collected together for reference or analysis. They can be either quantitative or qualitative, depending on their values and the question they aim to answer. More often, they are associated with the information which is produced by a machine or [[20220415230500]] computer.

“data are [[20220616094637]] representations of [[20220616094631]] observations, objects, or other [[20220616094614]] entities used as [[20220415234500]] evidence of [[20220415246700]] phenomena for the purposes of research or scholarship.” [@Borgman2015, xvii-xviii]

- [@Kent1978]

> The need to address [[20220418205352]] categories and levels of data is a pragmatic concern for managing information.  Yet data are often in the eye of the beholder.  In Buckland’s terms, data are [[20220415234500]] “alleged evidence”  [@Buckland1991].  What counts as good data varies widely, as one person’s noise is often another person’s signal.

## Data vs. Capta

In [[20220415230900]] digital humanities, many scholars like to refer to @Drucker2011, who argued that “the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed.”  Drucker claims that the term *data* is a reflection of a realist approach, and “[r]ealist approaches depend above all upon an idea that phenomena are *observer-independent* and can be characterized as *data*” [@Drucker2011, §1].

“Digital humanists” clearly love it when Drucker pits “humanism” against “the empirical sciences” and clamors for “a radical critique to return the humanistic tenets of constructed-ness and interpretation to the fore” [@Drucker2011, §1].  However, as [@Lavin2021, §5] observes, in actual practice, there are no signs of “a large-scale movement to purge documents of the word *data*, nor have the word *capta* or its cognates become especially prevalent in digital humanities scholarship.”

While Drucker’s constructivist position may first sight seem to match our own position, we think there are a number of issues with it.

First of all, Drucker is not the first to come up with the term *capta* to emphasize that data are not “given by nature”; @Jensen1950’s  remark from 1950 reads surprisingly similar:

> It is an unfortunate accident of history that the term *datum* (Latin, past participle of *do*, “to give”) rather than *captum* (Latin, past participle of *capere*, “to take”) should have come to symbolize the unit-phenomenon in science.  For science deals, not with “that which has been given” by nature to the scientist but with “that which has been taken” or selected from nature by the scientist in accordance with his purpose, and to a degree even constructed out of nature by the scientist’s preliminary assumptions as to which of “the things which have been given” are also to be “taken” or observed.  
—@Jensen1950 [ix]

I find it remarkable that apparently both Jensen and Drucker came up independently (because Drucker does not cite any source for it) with *capta* when looking for the opposite of *data*, because *capta* (which, as @Lavin2021 [29] notes, “may stir connotations of human bondage and violence”) is hardly the only possibility.  For example, *prensa* (from *prendere*) or *carpta* (from *carpere*) come to mind.

In any case, with respect to the constructedness of data, Jensen and Drucker certainly agree, and I agree as well.  In addition, Jensen’s observation concerns aspects of both [[20220415246900]] phenomenotechnique and [[20220616094613]] *découpage*.

However, while for Jensen, the term *data* is just “an unfortunate accident of history,” Drucker falls into her own trap (or that of the “critical” humanities) when she collapses the etymology of a word with its meaning, which is in addition assumed to be observer-independent: she simply identifies the use of the word *data* with a realist approach.  It does not seem to occur to her that even if we take “data” to actually mean “given,” that the meaning of “given” is not absolute and it in no way implies what she claims it does; @Lavin2021 also points out this fallacy and further elaborates on it.

[TODO] See also @Castelao-Lawless1995 on phenomenotechnique, especially §7, “Bachelard and the Social Constructivists”

Much more important than the etymology of a word is its *current* meaning; in particular, since *data* and *capta* (in Drucker’s sense) do not refer to different *things*, but to a different *attitude* of the speaker with respect to these things—it ultimately amounts to virtue signaling.  Kitchin offers a good summary:

> Strictly speaking, then, this book [*The Data Revolution*] should be entitled *The Capta Revolution*.  However, since the term data has become so thoroughly ingrained in the language of the academy and business to mean capta, rather than confuse the matter further it makes sense to continue to use the term data where capta would be more appropriate.  Beyond highlighting the etymological roots of the term, what this brief discussion starts to highlight is that data harvested through measurement are always a selection from the total sum of all possible data available – what we have chosen to take from all that could potentially be given.  As such, data are inherently partial, selective and representative, and the distinguishing criteria used in their capture has consequence.

The inadequacy of Drucker’s simplistic identification of “the empirical sciences” with realism becomes clear when we consider Rheinberger’s discussion of data in the context of scientific experiments [@Rheinberger2021, chap. 1].  For Rheinberger, experiments generate *traces*:

> Alles Experimentieren mündet in das Generieren von Spuren.  
—@Rheinberger2021 [22]
{lang=de}

As a concrete example of an experimental method, which even explicitly refers to traces, he discusses the method of *radioactive tracing*.  He points out that experimental traces are ephemeral and need to be transformed into persistent data, which can be annotated and processed.  Rheinberger also stresses that data are “nothing original, nothing ‘given,’ as the name suggests, but the result of some processing”:

> Sequenzgele wie auch andere experimentelle Spuren sind vergängliche Dinge. Zudem sieht man auf dem Gel erst einmal nichts, und so kann man es auch nicht bearbeiten. Um die Banden sichtbar zu machen, bearf es einer zusätzlichen Manipulation. Das gängige Verfahren dazu […] ist die Autoradiographie. Wenn die vorangehende Gelelektrophorese sozusangen noch nah am Material agierte und die Moleküle, um die es geht, aufnahm und entlang einer Raumachse verteilte, so macht sich die Autoradiographie allein die Strahlung der Moleküle zunutze und überträgt das – für sich genommen unsichtbare – Strahlungsmuster auf eine strahlungsempfindliche Filmplatte. Es wird damit zugleich sichtbar und dauerhaft konserviert. Außerdem kann die Fotografie bearbeitet werden: Man kann sie annotieren. Das sind alles Eigenschaften, die wir erwarten, wenn wir gemeinhin von Daten sprechen. Wir haben es also mit einer Transformation von flüchtigen Spuren in haltbare Daten zu tun. Daten sind demnach nichts Ursprüngliches, «Gegebenes», wie der Name suggeriert, sondern das Ergebnis einer Verarbeitung. Spuren werden in einem geeigneten Medium fixiert und können in dieser dauerhaften Form weitergehend bearbeitet werden.  
—@Rheinberger2021 [29]
{lang=de}

He summarizes:

> Mit der Verwandlung von Spuren in Daten, die alle letztlich als Zahlen-, Buchstaben- oder Pixelfolgen codiert werden, wird ein entscheidender Übergang vollzogen. Man kann ihn auch als einen Übergang von der Graphematik des Experimentierraums zur Repräsentation im Datenraum betrachten. Die vielleicht wichtigste Konsequenz dieses Übergangs besteht darin, dass die spurenhaften Ergebnisse eines Experiments in eine Form gebracht werden, in der sie gespeichert und auch wieder abgerufen und damit verarbeitet, mit anderen Daten verglichen und dann auch zu Mustern verdichtet werden können. Es spricht einiges für die Annahme, dass die so geschaffene Dauerhaftigkeit das wichtigste Merkmal der Transposition von Spuren in Daten darstellt. Diese Fixierung ist die Voraussetzung für ihre neue Beweglichkeit im Datenraum, eine Eigenschaft, die den Spuren im Spurenraum fehlt.  
—@Rheinberger2021 [32]

Obviously, this cannot be directly applied to the humanities (and history in particular), as there is no experiment—and the extant historical traces are already persistent, which is precisely why we have them.  However, like experimental traces, they usually cannot be processed directly.  The transformation of historical traces into data (whatever this may involve) is less about making them persistent (even though this is an aspect that is often evoked in the context of the preservation of cultural heritage), but—like for experimental traces—the “mobility in the data space.”

> For as the  father of sociological positivism well knew, even if his modern representatives have sometimes seemed to forget it, the preliminary assumptions which one makes concerning the nature of the data that any given science investigates determine not only the kinds of interpretative hypotheses which can be verified, but also the rational and empirical principles and processes which must guide scientific inquiry.  By determining the former, the preliminary assumptions of sociological positivism determine and limit the possible body of substantive sociological theory, and by determining the latter they likewise determine and limit its methodology.  In consequence, we have accumulated an enormous mass of factual data,³ but few significant sociological generalizations to interpret them, and have produced a large number of handbooks on fact-fining and other research *techniques*, but little *methodological* literature in the strict sense of systematic and critical analysis and organization of the basic assumptions concerning the nature of the phenomena to be investigated, of the methods of processing and reasoning about them, and of drawing inferences from them and from the conditions under which they occur in order to interpret them as accurately as possible.
