[[20220415234900]] Facts and [[20220415252400]] statistics collected together for reference or analysis. They can be either quantitative or qualitative, depending on their values and the question they aim to answer. More often, they are associated with the information which is produced by a machine or [[20220415230500]] computer.

“data are [[20220616094637]] representations of [[20220616094631]] observations, objects, or other [[20220616094614]] entities used as [[20220415234500]] evidence of [[20220415246700]] phenomena for the purposes of research or scholarship.” [@Borgman2015, xvii-xviii]

## Data vs. Capta

In [[20220415230900]] digital humanities, many scholars like to point to @Drucker2011, who argued that “the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed.”  Drucker claims that the term *data* is a reflection of a realist approach, and “[r]ealist approaches depend above all upon an idea that phenomena are *observer-independent* and can be characterized as *data*” [@Drucker2011, §1].

“Digital humanists” clearly love it when Drucker pits “humanism” against “the empirical sciences” and clamors for “a radical critique to return the humanistic tenets of constructed-ness and interpretation to the fore” [@Drucker2011, §1].  However, as [@Lavin2021, §5] observes, in actual practice, there are no signs of “a large-scale movement to purge documents of the word *data*, nor have the word *capta* or its cognates become especially prevalent in digital humanities scholarship.”

While Drucker’s constructivist position may first sight seem to match our own position, we think there are a number of issues with it.

First of all, Drucker is not the first to come up with the term *capta* to emphasize that data are not “given by nature”; @Jensen1950’s  remark from 1950 reads surprisingly similar:

> It is an unfortunate accident of history that the term *datum* (Latin, past participle of *do*, “to give”) rather than *captum* (Latin, past participle of *capere*, “to take”) should have come to symbolize the unit-phenomenon in science.  For science deals, not with “that which has been given” by nature to the scientist but with “that which has been taken” or selected from nature by the scientist in accordance with his purpose, and to a degree even constructed out of nature by the scientist’s preliminary assumptions as to which of “the things which have been given” are also to be “taken” or observed.  
—@Jensen1950 [ix]

I find it remarkable that apparently both Jensen and Drucker came up independently (because Drucker does not cite any source for it) with *capta* when looking for the opposite of *data*, because *capta* (which, as @Lavin2021 [29] notes, “may stir connotations of human bondage and violence”) is hardly the only possibility.  For example, *prensa* (from *prendere*) or *carpta* (from *carpere*) come to mind.

In any case, with respect to the constructedness of data, Jensen and Drucker certainly agree, and I agree as well.  In addition, Jensen’s observation concerns aspects of both [[20220415246900]] phenomenotechnique and [[20220616094613]] *découpage*.

However, while for Jensen, the term *data* is just “an unfortunate accident of history,” Drucker falls into her own trap (or that of the “critical” humanities) when she collapses the etymology of a word with its meaning, which is in addition assumed to be observer-independent: she simply identifies the use of the word *data* with a realist approach.  It does not seem to occur to her that even if we take “data” to actually mean “given,” that the meaning of “given” is not absolute and it in no way implies what she claims it does; @Lavin2021 also points out this fallacy and further elaborates on it.

[TODO] See also @Castelao-Lawless1995 of phenomenotechnique, especially §7, “Bachelard and the Social Constructivists”

Much more important than the etymology of a word is its *current* meaning; in particular, since *data* and *capta* (in Drucker’s sense) do not refer to different *things*, but to a different *attitude* of the speaker with respect to these things—it ultimately amounts to virtue signaling.  Kitchin offers a good summary:

> Strictly speaking, then, this book [*The Data Revolution*] should be entitled *The Capta Revolution*.  However, since the term data has become so thoroughly ingrained in the language of the academy and business to mean capta, rather than confuse the matter further it makes sense to continue to use the term data where capta would be more appropriate.  Beyond highlighting the etymological roots of the term, what this brief discussion starts to highlight is that data harvested through measurement are always a selection from the total sum of all possible data available – what we have chosen to take from all that could potentially be given.  As such, data are inherently partial, selective and representative, and the distinguishing criteria used in their capture has consequence.

> For as the  father of sociological positivism well knew, even if his modern representatives have sometimes seemed to forget it, the preliminary assumptions which one makes concerning the nature of the data that any given science investigates determine not only the kinds of interpretative hypotheses which can be verified, but also the rational and empirical principles and processes which must guide scientific inquiry.  By determining the former, the preliminary assumptions of sociological positivism determine and limit the possible body of substantive sociological theory, and by determining the latter they likewise determine and limit its methodology.  In consequence, we have accumulated an enormous mass of factual data,³ but few significant sociological generalizations to interpret them, and have produced a large number of handbooks on fact-fining and other research *techniques*, but little *methodological* literature in the strict sense of systematic and critical analysis and organization of the basic assumptions concerning the nature of the phenomena to be investigated, of the methods of processing and reasoning about them, and of drawing inferences from them and from the conditions under which they occur in order to interpret them as accurately as possible.
