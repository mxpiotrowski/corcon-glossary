Qualitative research involves collecting and analyzing non-numerical data (i.e. text, video, or audio) to understand concepts, opinions or experiences. It can be used to gather in-depth insights into a problem or generate new ideas for research. It focusses on answering qualitative (why, how, to what extend etc.) questions.
