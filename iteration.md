The repetition of a process in order to generate a sequence of outcomes. Each repetition of the process is a single iteration, and the outcome of each iteration serves as the starting point of the next iteration. In [[202204152425]] mathematics and [[202204152277]] computer science, iteration is a standard element of algorithms. (*Wikipedia*)
