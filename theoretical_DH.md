One of the two parts of Piotrowski’s “double definition” of [[20220415230900]] digital humanities [@Piotrowski2018a; @Piotrowski2018d].

In contrast to [[20220415224200]] applied digital humanities, *theoretical digital humanities* is not concerned with humanities research objects and objectives, but with the general properties of the computational models constructed in applied DH.  In other words, theoretical computational humanities create and study the *metamodels* whose concrete application in the humanities is the domain of applied computational humanities, as well as the methodology for constructing these metamodels.

Because of their metascientific nature, the theoretical computational humanities are neither “quantitative” nor “qualitative.”  They aim to develop abstract models, metamodels, which may or may not have a quantitative dimension, but the research question underlying them is the *adequacy* of these models, not their application:

{lang=fr}
> De par leur caractère métascientifique, les humanités numériques théoriques ne sont ni « quantitatives » ni « qualitatives ». Elles visent à développer des modèles abstraits, des métamodèles, qui peuvent posséder une dimension quantitative ou non, mais la question de recherche qui les sous-tend est celle de l’adéquation de ces modèles, non de leur application.  
—@Piotrowski2018d [¶29]

The theoretical computational humanities therefore serve as metascience for the applied computational humanities.  As such, they could in principle be considered as a sub-discipline of [[20220415227700]] computer science, concerned with the application of computing to a specific field, in this case the humanities.

According to [@Piotrowski2018d]:

{lang=fr}
> nous sommes donc d’accord avec la proposition de Meunier (2017) de concevoir les humanités numériques – nous dirions plus précisément les humanités numériques théoriques – « comme des types spécifiques de projets d’intelligence artificielle, mais où les “symboles” sont ceux qui, cette fois, désignent des réalités qui intéressent diverses sciences humaines et sociales (SHS) et que l’on veut traiter de manière computationnelle. » [@Meunier2017, 21]  
—@Piotrowski2018d [¶28]

The qualification “theoretical” is sometimes misunderstood; to clarify:

1. “Theoretical” is here not used in its everyday meaning, i.e., as the opposite of “practical.”  It rather refers to the fact, that theoretical DH is not applied to *concrete* research questions in the humanities.  Thus, its meaning corresponds rather to that of “theoretical” in, e.g., [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science) or [theoretical ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_ecology).
2. A related misunderstanding stems from the fact that the term [[20220415254000]] *theory* is understood differently in the humanities and in the natural sciences and engineering.  In the humanities, *theory* often refers to something that is closer to a school of thought or an ideology (see, e.g., [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory)).
3. Even though methodological and epistemological questions play in my view a central role in theoretical DH, it would also be a misunderstanding to reduce theoretical DH to *only* philosophical reflections on DH and its [[20220418210120]] methodology and [[20220415234300]] epistemology.
