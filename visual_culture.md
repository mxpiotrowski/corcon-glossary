"Culture of [[20220415238900]] images and visuality that creates meaning in our world today. [...]
The emergence of the [[20220415227900]] concept of visual culture as a means to think about the role of images in culture and as an academic field of study is a relatively recent phenomenon, emerging in the late 1980s and becoming established by the late 1990s. [...]
In the study of visual culture, the core concept that images generate meanings that can change in different contexts is aligned with the concept that the meaning of images is derived from their reading by viewers–consumers, rather than simply residing solely in the images themselves. Culture is thus produced in complex [[20220415244700]] networks of exchange through which meanings are co-created by members of a society or group. [...]
The study of visual culture posits that visual images play a crucial role in the meaning–making of culture, and that they do so increasingly in relation to how information is [[20220616094637]] represented"
