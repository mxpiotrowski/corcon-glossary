A corpus, like any other collection of items, can be classified according to its type. Since the most systematic study of corpora comes from the area of corpus linguistics, we present some of the most basic corpus types as defined by some of the field's specialists (@Pearson1998, @Hunston2002, @Ludeling2008, @Dash2018). Of course, corpora can include all kinds of objects (i.e. images, artifacts, recordings etc.), however we mainly refer here to linguistic corpora, specifically those that are digitized. 

Purpose and language seem to play a central role in classifying corpora. In terms of the first, two of the most basic categories are: 

- general-purpose corpora (or general corpora): according to @Dash2018, "a general corpus, in principle, contains texts of the general type belonging to various disciplines, genres, subject fields, and register variations. With regard to form and utility, a general corpus can be made very large with an infinite amount of data, as well as with an innumerable number of text samples."
- task-based corpora (or special corpora): corpora, the design of which is dependent on the specific tasks, set by their creators. As @Dash2018 notes, "the primary goal of a special corpus is to capture the special aspects and properties of a language that investigators want to explore, to identify and mark their specialty". In this category, various subtypes are observed, such as the comparable, reference, lerner and opportunistic corpora, each serving a specific, name-explanatory purpose. 

According to the language or languages, in which they are written, corpora can be organised into:

- monolingual: the textual items inside the corpus share the same natural language (most common case).
- bilingual: the textual items are written in two languages. A typical example of this type is the translation or the aligned corpus (see below).
- multilingual: the corpus consists of textual elements which are written in more than two languages. 

There are also other corpus types, which are defined by the language element, such as the translation corpora (either bilingual or multiligual, which are less common), in which every text or a certain number of texts is accompanied by translation, either incorporated in the same document, or in seperate one(s). Another example is the sublanguage corpus, which "typically exhibits particular types of lexical, semantic and other restrictions and deviance from that of the general language" (@Dash2018).

In terms of the time range or period, during which the particular items are dated, corpora can be:

- synchronic corpora: corpora, which are dated in present time. 
- diachronic corpora: corpora, which are dated in various periods of the past. A diachronic corpus is the historical corpus (see below).

 Moreover, corpora can be classified as discipline or field-specific. Representative examples of this sort in the humanities, are:
 
 - literary corpora: corpora which are relevant from a literary point of view and are constructed to assist literary scholarship. "In the case of the literary corpus, criteria that are considered relevant for classifying a corpus text may include various parameters, such as the following: a particular author (e.g. Shakespeare), a text type of single author (e.g. plays of Shakespeare), a particular text of single author (e.g. Corpus of Ulysses), a particular genre of text (e.g. novels), a particular period (e.g. 18th Century English novels), a particular group (e.g. romantic poets), a particular theme (e.g. revolutionary writings)" (@Dash2018).
 - historical and historiographical corpora: from the perspective of the history of language, "historical corpora are intentionally created to represent and investigate past stages of a language and/or to study language change. A historical corpus concerns periods before the present-day language" (@Ludeling2008). Historiographical corpora, on the other hand, are ideal to study how the history was written in different historical periods. Aside from the linguistic interest, the study of historiographical phenomena or periods are a key aspect.
 - journalistic/informative: corpora, which are comprised of social media posts and messages, or news feed instances.
 - pedagogic corpora: @Hunston2002 states, that "a pedagogic corpus can be used to collect together for the learner all instances of a word or phrase they have come across in different contexts, for the purpose of raising awareness. It can also be compared with a corpus of naturally occuring English to check that the learner is being presented with language that is natural-sounding and useful".
 
 Other types of corpora are formulated in respect to their document structure or format. Examples of those, are annotated and unannotated corpora. These are very general categories, which can be further subdivided according to the level and form of annotation. In terms of the annotated ones, special reference is given to the multimodal corpora. Those categories are briefly descibed as follows:
 
- annotated corpora: corpora, which contain certain annotations and annotation standards. According to @Ludeling2008, the standards are a "well-elaborated set of rules and procedures that is generally accepted, and at the same time frequently used and integrated into common corpus creation and processing tools". 
- unannotated corpora: corpora, which do not contain annotations. For @Dash2018, "an unannotated corpus represents the simple raw state of plain texts collected from a language. That means text samples that are included in a corpus are in their simple format without any additional information tagged to them from external sources".
- (annotated) multimodal corpora: As @Ludeling2008 states, "a multimodal digitized corpus is a computer-based collection of language and communication-related material drawing on more than one sensory modality or on more than one production modality". She adds, that "a multimodal corpus is a digitized collection of language and communication-related material, drawing on more than one modality. In a more narrow sense, we might require that the audiovisual material should be accompanied by transcriptions and annotations or codings based on the material. This definition is more narrow, since there is a specification of the nature of the language and communication related material" (@Ludeling2008).
 
 Another essential division has to do with the corpus accessibility and sense of completeness. Those corpora that are openly accessible and downloadable through an online interface are classified as open-access, while those that their accessibility is limited or completely denied to the perspective user, are characterized as closed and/or inaccessible or partially accessible. Lisence issues also play an important role in accessing corpora in the Web. As far as the completeness (or incompleteness) of a corpus is concerned, a widely common example is the monitor corpus, which "is a representative corpus in the sense that it grows continuously with time to include infinite numbers and varieties of text samples from all possible sources of written and spoken language to represent the language in its truest possible sense" (@Dash2018). It should be noted here that a corpus can be classified to more than one types.
 
 From all the above-mentioned examples, one could easily grasp that the type of a corpus highly depends on his creator. His judgment and perspective is the ultimate factor, which enables a number of different parameters to be imposed for the construction of the corpus  (i.e. which items will be included, their overall number, how similar or homogenous are those items, how unique or structured are they and according to what standards etc.). This adds to the observation that corpora are models of certain phenomena, constructed by a number of subjects/users for a particular purpose or purposes (see _model_ entry and Stachowiak's three pivotal characteristics of models).
