"Term used to describe a method of expressing complex abstract [[20220616094622]] ideas or a work of art composed according to this. An allegory is principally constructed from personifications and [[20220616094640]] symbols [...], and, though overlapping in function, it is thus more sophisticated in both meaning and operation than either of these. It is found primarily in Western art and constitutes an important area of study in [[20220616094621]] Iconography and iconology.
Allegory, a means of making the ‘invisible’ visible, is a product of the philosophical thought of Classical antiquity and was used by the ancients not only in the fine arts but also in literature and rhetoric [...]
The mechanism of allegory further distinguishes it from both symbolism and personification. Symbolism, in ordinary parlance, occurs when an object is used by convention to refer to a general idea, while personification occurs when abstract terms are expressed by human figures, generally with significant attributes. An allegory, however, includes combinations of personifications and/or symbols, which, on the basis of a conventionally agreed relation between [[20220415227900]] concept and [[20220616094637]] representation, refer to an idea outside the work of art."
