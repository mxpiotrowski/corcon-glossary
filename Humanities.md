The humanities are the academic disciplines that study aspects of human society and culture. In the Renaissance, the term was assosiated with divinity and referred to what is now called classics, the main area of secular study in universities at that time. Today, the humanities are more frequently defined as any field of study outside of the natural, social and economic sciences. The humanities use methods that are primarily critical or speculative. They include the study of ancient and modern languages, literature, philosophy, history, archaeology, anthropology, human geography (or ethnology), law, religion and art and they have no central discipline.
