Project which aims to develop a central information platform for medieval and early modern manuscripts, which will supersede the online database Manuscripta Mediaevalia on a cutting-edge technical basis. The [*Handschriftenportal*](https://handschriftenportal.de/?lang=en) will assemble descriptive information on manuscripts in German collections, as well as record or integrate digital facsimiles of the original manuscripts. All of the data on the platform will be made available in interoperable exchange formats.
