In logic, [[20220415242500]] mathematics, [[20220415227700]] computer science, and [[20220415227100]] (computational) linguistics, a [*formal language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) consists of words whose letters are taken from an alphabet and are well-formed according to a specific set of rules.

Thus, in opposition to [[20220415244400]] natural languages, the lexicon and the syntax of formal languages are fully defined.  Formal languages are entirely syntactic in nature, but may be given [[20220616094638]] semantics that give meaning to the elements of the language.  For example, programming languages have [operational semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_semantics), i.e., the computations that they cause a machine to execute.
