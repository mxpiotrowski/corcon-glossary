- historiographical uncertainty, which concerns the interpretation of the facts, especially when used as evidence for a particular narrative (CREATE talk)

MP: Not fully worked out idea: treat uncertainty as some kind of pattern matching over some kind of relationship graph.

> Relationships are the stuff of which information is made.  Just about everything in the information system looks like a relationship.  
—@Kent1998 [73] [= @Kent1978, 63]

For going beyond concrete relationship *instances*, Kent suggests that we “think of a relationship (not an instance) as a pattern, given as a sequence of categories (e.g., departments and employes)” [@Kent1998, 74].  He then writes:

> Specifying the pattern of a relationship as a sequence of categories is sometimes too restrictive.  There are many relationships that permit several categories to occur at the same “position”, as is the case when one can “own” many kinds of things.  We therefore introduce the term “domain” to designate all the things that may occur at a given position in the relationship.  A domain may include several categories.  Thus we might describe an “owns” relationship as having two domains, with the first domain including such categories as employees, departments, and divisions, while the second domain included such categories as furniture, vehicles, stationery supplies, computers, etc.  
—@Kent1998 [74–75]

If we consider uncertainty a “lack of information,” information as relationships (in the sense of Kent), and relationships as patterns, then many types of uncertainty could probably described as incompletely specified relationships: open slots cannot be filled by just anything, but the filler must *match*.

And indeed, also regular expressions for strings describe uncertainty, such as *a* followed by five characters (we are uncertain about which ones exactly), followed by *b*.
