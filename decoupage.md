The term *découpage* is central for [[20220415236100]] Gilles-Gaston Granger’s philosophy of science, and @Granger1967 dedictates a full chapter to this notion (Chapter 4, *Le découpage des phénomènes*)—but does not give an explicit definition.

In his introduction to the English translation of @Granger1967, Rosenberg notes:

> ‘*Découpage*’ is one of the few words that has been left untranslated in the present work, for it expresses an especially central notion for Granger’s philosophy of science, and there is no single English term that captures its precise meaning and flavor.  
—@Granger1983 [xvi–xvii]

He tries to explain its meaning via the English word *découpage*, “the technique of decorating a surface with cut-outs, and ‘cut-out’ is the most direct and the simplest literal translation of the French ‘*decoupage*’.”

I agree with Rosenberg that “by this term Granger means to suggest that out of the amorphous material of experience, science must separate, mold, shape, contour, arrange and refine its objects.”  But Rosenberg himself seems to feel that the English word *découpage* does not quite cut it (pun not intended):

> This *découpage* must be an active process, involving the coordination of theoretical and practical results in the delineation of objects which can satisfy the syntactical restrictions characteristic of scientific language.  
—@Granger1983 [xvii]

I find it puzzling that he nevertheless misses the original meaning of *découpage*, viz. “action, manière de découper.”  The examples given by various dictionaries revolve around meat and poultry: “Le découpage d’un poulet,” “Découper une pièce de viande,” etc.  This seems to be a much more obvious analogy, and certainly one that would be so obvious to a French speaker that it is understandable why Granger did not feel the need to explain it.

A possible English translation could thus perhaps have been “the carving out of the phenomenon”—but we’ll stick to *découpage* now.

Rosenberg’s discussion of *découpage* is also bizarre in another respect; he writes:

> In fact, as noted previously, the activity of *découpage* is nothing less than the determination of the natural kinds which scientific theory treats.  Granger does not employ the expression ‘natural kinds’; rather he talks of ‘the scientific object’.  And the aim of the scientific *découpage* is the substitution of scientific objects for the objects ‘given’ in ordinary experience, and our everyday conceptual scheme.  
—@Granger1983 [xvii]

While I agree with the second part of this passage, I think it is strange to invoke [natural kinds](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-kinds/) when discussing Granger’s [[20220415234300]] epistemology—Rosenberg himself points out that “Granger does not employ the expression ‘natural kinds’.”  Granger is not only a student of [[20220415224900]] Bachelard, but the very notion of *découpage* is at odds with the idea of “natural kinds,” and Granger explicitly states:

{lang=fr}
> Quant à l’intentionalité scientifique, à la visée, nous l’avons déjà définie comme construction de *modèles cohérents et efficaces du phénomène*.  
—@Granger1967 [215]

Thus, Granger’s notion of *découpage* is, I believe, closely related to Bachelard’s [[20220415246900]] *phénoménotechnique*: both notions relate to the constructedness of the scientific [[20220415246700]] phenomenon.
