title: causality

The quality or action of influence by which one event or [[20220415234900]] fact causes or it is caused by another (one event or fact stimulates the appearance of another event or fact, i.e. A causes B and B causes C and so on). The causality could be multi-directional and it can influence directly or indirectly some or all the variables included in a causal relation (i.e. A causes B and C and at the same time C can cause B and A and so on).

> But Bloxham needs robust conceptual tools to do this, since speaking strictly from within historiography would lead him into the same scattershot thinking that the historians whom he critiques use. He has two strong pairs of concepts, which will be my focus in much of what follows. The first major group of concepts he brings to bear for this purpose is causation and context and the relations between them. As he says, “few historians have tried to conceptualize” context, though most talk about it (3). His view is that context “means nothing other than ‘cause’ and, generally in humanistic explanations, cause in the weaker sense of ‘influence’ as opposed to the stronger sense of ‘determination’” (17–18). As he explains, “context tends to be seen as more fundamental than ‘cause,’ but there is, in fact, no conceptual distinction between a cause and a context. … [B]oth have influence over an eventualization, and what has influence over an eventu- alization is a cause” (30). Bloxham’s neologism “eventualization” enables him to skip around some difficult issues in philosophy of science and metaphysics here.
