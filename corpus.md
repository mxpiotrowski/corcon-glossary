The notion of *corpus* comes from [[20220415227100]] computational linguistics.  It is usually understood as a collection of [[20220415253200]] texts that fulfils certain criteria.

In linguistics, Douglas Biber has been influential in defining criteria for corpora such as *balancedness* and *representativeness* [see, e.g., @Biber1990; @Biber1993].  Often the presence of [[20220415223600]] annotation is also considered essential.  Corpora are today assumed to be machine-readable; some authors consider this a defining characteristic.

In [[20220415230900]] digital humanities, the usage of the term *corpus* is inspired by the one in computational linguistics [@Piotrowski2018c], but tends to be looser.  The items in a corpus are not necessarily texts, but may also be complete [[20220415232900]] documents or any other type of digital object, e.g., [[20220415238900]] images.  Consequently, the type of annotation varies also widely, and there is often no distinction between annotation and [[20220415243000]] metadata.  The distinction between a corpus and a collection is thus not clear in DH, to the extent that the terms are probably often used interchangeably.

In our view, a corpus is a [[20220415244100]] model.  Most, if not all, of the defining characteristics directly or indirectly follow from this.  In principle, one could go as far as doing away with the requirement that a corpus is a kind of collection.  However, it seems that little is gained by abandoning the term *corpus* to describe a specific *type* of model.
