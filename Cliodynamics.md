Transdisciplinary area of research that integrates cultural evolution, economic history/cliometrics, macrosociology, the mathematical modeling of historical processes during the longue dur√©e and the construction and analysis of historical databases. Cliodynamics treats history as mere science. Its practitioners develop theories that explain such dynamical processes as the rise and fall of empires, population booms and busts, as well as the spread and disappearance of religions.
