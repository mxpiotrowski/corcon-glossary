Despite the fuzziness of the term, @Becher2001 [41] note that people “with any interest and involvement in academic affairs seem to have little difficulty in understanding what a discipline is, or in taking a confident part in discussions about borderline or dubious cases.”  @Krishnan2009 identifies six fundamental characteristics of academic disciplines:

1. a specific object of research (which may be shared with other disciplines);
2. a body of accumulated specialist knowledge referring to their object of research, which is specific to them and not generally shared with another discipline;
3. theories and concepts that serve to organize the body of accumulated expertise;
4. terminology or technical language adjusted to their research object;
5. specific research methods;
6. lastly, and probably most crucially, an institutional manifestation in the form of subjects taught at universities.

@Krishnan2009 stresses that only through institutionalization can disciplines endure from one generation to the next.  A discipline is therefore typically founded by the creation of a professorial chair dedicated to it in an established university.  He also notes that not all disciplines exhibit all six characteristics, but that in general, a field of academic research is more likely to be recognized as an autonomous discipline capable of developing its own body of knowledge the closer it is to this ideal model [@Krishnan2009, 10].

I would argue that—apart from institutional factors—a discipline is characterized above all by a particular combination of the following *two* aspects:

1. an object of research and
2. a research objective.

*Research methods* are a third aspect, but one that plays only a secondary role: they depend on the research object and the research objective, and on scientific and technological progress, which requires their adaptation and allows them to evolve, while the research object and the research objective remain stable.  In addition, academic disciplines always use a variety of methods: for example, although the use of qualitative methods can probably be considered “typical” of research in humanities disciplines, quantitative methods also play a significant role, and the reverse holds for the “hard” sciences as well.

An important function of disciplines is *evaluation*.  Academic freedom—where it exists—grants scholars the privilege to choose their own research topics.  This means, however, that the quality of the research cannot be evaluated externally, but at best by other researchers working on similar problems.  Disciplines ensure—primarily through peer review—that certain standards are respected, that work is adequately evaluated, and that students receive comparable training.  As @Turner2000 points out:

> The fact that a lot of people are trained in fundamentally the same way makes it possible for them to effectively make judgements about the quality of the work done by other people and for regimes of training to themselves be evaluated for their rigour.
