According to [@Rheinberger2005, 315-316]: "For the purposes of the present essay, we can take Bachelard’s notion of “noumenon” to be roughly equivalent to the ordinary notion of concept or scientiac law, provided we respect Gayon’s caveat that it has to be taken neither as an arbitrary hypothesis nor an immutable essence, but rather as an entity in oux, a sort of “progress of thought” (Gayon 1995, p. 43)."
