Max Bense (* February 7, 1910 in Strasbourg, † 29 April 1990 in Stuttgart) was a German philosopher, writer, and publicist, known for his work in philosophy of science, logic, aesthetics, and semiotics.  His thoughts combine natural sciences, art, and philosophy under a collective perspective and follow a definition of reality, which—under the term existential rationalism—is able to remove the separation between humanities and natural sciences.  (Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Bense).)

Bense was the doctoral supervisor of [[20232026212051]] Georg Klaus in Jena and worked with [[20220622005957]] Abraham Moles at the Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm.
