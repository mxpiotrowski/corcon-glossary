The term *computational thinking* already occurs in @Papert1980, but it was popularized by @Wing2006‌.  Especially in the context of US education, computational thinking has become a buzzword that means different things to different people, which has lead some [[20220415227700]] computer scientists to identify it with programming skills or to reject it completely [e.g., @Guzdial2019], whereas others consider it useful [e.g., @Nardelli2019; @Denning2021].

In fact, @Wing2006 is quite clear:

> Thinking like a computer scientist means more than being able to program a computer. It requires thinking at multiple levels of abstraction.  
—@Wing2006 [34]

Fortunately, @Denning2019 have written an excellent little book on computational thinking.  It is already on page 4 that the authors present their definition:

> Computational thinking is the mental skills and practices for:
>
> - *designing* computations that get computers to do jobs for us, and
> - *explaining* and interpreting the world as a complex of information processes.  
—@Denning2019 [4]

This is a good starting point, but it still lacks a crucial notion.  Here is how I would define computational thinking:

> The term *computational thinking* describes the skills required to build [[20220415227300]] computational models.

In fact, you can find this idea in @Wing2006, but it is not very explicit.  She writes:

> *Complements and combines mathematical and engineering thinking*.  Computer science inherently draws on mathematical thinking, given that, like all sciences, its formal foundations rest on mathematics.  Computer science inherently draws on engineering thinking, given that we build systems that interact with the real world.  The constraints of the underlying computing device force computer scientists to think computationally, not just mathematically.  Being free to build virtual worlds enables us to engineer systems beyond the physical world.  
—@Wing2006 [35]

The term *computational thinking* thus describes a set of related skills whose history is much older than that of computer science in the modern sense of the word and adds others.
