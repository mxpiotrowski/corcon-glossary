History is the study and the documentation of the past. *History* is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation and interpretation of these events. Historians seek to gain knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts and material artifacts (art). History is also an academic discipline which uses narratives to describe, examine, question and analyze past events, and investigate patterns of their cause and effect. Historians often debate concerning which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. (*Wikipedia*)
