The *digital* or *computational turn* [[20220415232300]] in the humanities [[]] is understood as the gradual shift from traditional, manually-dominated research practices to digital ones, being carried out in the environments of the computer. It serves as the milestone that scholars often use to describe the utilization of computational tools and methods in humanities research.

According to Berry, this change of practices in the humanities [[]] can be historically placed in two major turning points (or as he calls them, *waves*), mentioned as Digital Humanities 1.0 and 2.0, each one charactirized by different approaches in doing research [@Berry2011]. He states:

> “the first wave of Digital Humanities scholarship in the late 1990s and early 2000s tended to focus on large-scale digitization [[]] projects and the establishment of technological infrastructure, [while] the current second wave of Digital Humanities -- what can be called ‘Digital Humanities 2.0’ -- is deeply generative, creating the environments and tools for producing, curating, and interacting with knowledge that is ‘born digital’ and lives in various digital contexts.” 
-@Berry2011 

In the discipline of history [[]], central to the humanities [[]], this reform is more visible than in other humanities areas of study. According to Romein et.al., 1960s gave rise to *quantitative history* (or *cliometrics* [[]]), while 20 years later this area of research was abandoned and a new one took its place, known as *history and computing*. With the emergence of the web in the 1990s, the discipline ivolved further to what we now call as *digital history*, which kept much of its former quantitative status.   

Nowadays, computational methods have become an integral part of the everyday life of every scholar within the field.
