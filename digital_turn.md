The digital or computational turn [[]] in the humanities [[]] is being understood as the gradual shift from traditional, manually-dominated research practices to digital ones, being carried out in the environments of the computer. It serves historically as the landmark which pinpoints the utilization of computational methods in humanities research.

According to Berry, this change of practices in the humanities [[]] is described by the terms Digital Humanities 1.0 and 2.0 [@Berry2011]. He mentions:

“the first wave of Digital Humanities scholarship in the late 1990s and early 2000s tended to focus on large-scale digitization projects and the establishment of technological infrastructure, [while] the current second wave of Digital Humanities -- what can be called ‘Digital Humanities 2.0’ -- is deeply generative, creating the environments and tools for producing, curating, and interacting with knowledge that is ‘born digital’ and lives in various digital contexts.” (@Berry2011) 

A correlation with Brenner and Kreiss’s notion of digitalization [[]] which refers to the changes brought by computational models [[]] that digitization [[]] (conversion of analog information to binary one) has enabled to be created (@Brenner&Kreiss2016), seems to be relevant.
