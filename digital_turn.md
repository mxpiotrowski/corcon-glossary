The *digital* or *computational turn* in the [[20220415238200]] humanities is understood as the gradual shift from traditional, manually-dominated research practices to digital ones, being carried out in the environments of the computer. It serves as the milestone that scholars often use to describe the utilization of computational tools and methods in humanities research.

According to Berry, this change of practices in the [[20220415238200]] humanities can be historically placed in two major turning points (or as he calls them, *waves*), mentioned as Digital Humanities 1.0 and 2.0, each one charactirized by different approaches in doing research [@Berry2011]. He states, that:

> the first wave of Digital Humanities scholarship in the late 1990s and early 2000s tended to focus on large-scale digitization projects and the establishment of technological infrastructure, [while] the current second wave of Digital Humanities -- what can be called ‘Digital Humanities 2.0’ -- is deeply generative, creating the environments and tools for producing, curating, and interacting with knowledge that is ‘born digital’ and lives in various digital contexts.  —@Berry2011

In the discipline of [[20220415237900]] history, central to the [[20220415238200]] humanities, this reform is more visible than in other humanities areas. According to Romein et.al., 1960s gave rise to *quantitative history* (or [[20220415226200]] *cliometrics*), while 20 years later this area of research was abandoned and a new one took its place, known as *history and computing*. With the emergence of the web in the 1990s, the discipline ivolved further to what we now call as [[20220415230800]] *digital history*, which kept much of its former quantitative status [@Romein2020]. 

The benefits of the digital turn can be easily grasped in a practical level. As @Nicholson2013 points out, ' [[20220415231600]] digitalization has made research faster, easier, more convinient and more productive', effecting all the areas of research in the humanities. In his own discipline, *media history*, digitizing projects have enabled the online storage and processing of massive amounts of newspaper [[20220415229300]] data, which would otherwise have been extremely hard to organize. New digitizing methods, such as computer vision and CCN (Concolotional Neural Networks) were used to gain a high-level understanding of images [@Wevers2019]. However, he points out that many scholars still remain sceptical concerning possible pitfalls in digital research:

> Historians have responded to the emergence of online archives with cautious enthusiasm. Much debate has surrounded the pitfalls and drawbacks of digital research. Leary has warned of an overreliance on online archives and the dangers of an ‘offline penumbra’... Some researchers have rightly expressed concerns about access to commercial archives, and the ownership and selection of their contents (Mussell). The accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) software has attracted much criticism, whilst other commentators have warned of the dangers of what might be termed ‘keyword blinkers’, arriving directly at a source and bypassing its wider context.  —@Nicholson2013

In spite of these concerns, it is a common belief that digital technology has offered new possibilities and an entirely different way of doing research in the humanities.  Nowadays, computational methods have become an integral part of scholar's everyday life. However, the term 'digital turn' and the way is being used remains ambiguous.
